Suppose you have some aluminum mini blinds... but the cords are
broken.  Should you buy new mini blinds to replace them?  Well,
nowadays aluminum mini blinds appear to be pretty scarce on the
market, purportedly having been replaced by cheaper and lighter vinyl
mini blinds.  So if you do want to switch to a different type of mini
blinds, that would probably be a good move.  That being said, you
should hold onto your expensive aluminum mini blinds and consider
rolling up your sleeves for a repair of the cords rather than a
replacement of the entire blinds.

First of all, how did the cords of my blinds get broken?  Basically,
the carriage mechanism was unfortunately designed such that it
effectively slowly cut/torn on the cords when manipulated.  So, that
would be ideal to change, fix, and replace, but I'll get to that
later.

For now, I wanted to point out that doing repairs on the cords is
actually rather easy.  If you have your familiar soldering iron, that
is your best bet for easily melting the plastic-based cords to fuse
them back together.  Otherwise, you use a match to heat up the cords
to melt and fuse them together.
