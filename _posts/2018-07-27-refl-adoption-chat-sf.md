Interesting.  Atlassian is selling their HipChat and other weird new
chat product to Slack.  (What was it called?  Oh, it was called
Stride!)  A migration path to Slack will be programmed, and the old
systems will be retired.  These systems predated Slack, but Slack
added more features faster and grew more customers faster.

Important!  So, the point in hand here.  In the long run, it doesn't
matter how long your product was established and how old it is.  It
matters how many people adopt it.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is still aggressively trying to play its
marketing tactics to keep people from buying Slack.  Microsoft Teams,
this cheap product that looks like it's barely written by one person,
is still around and boasts a large number of users.  It is being given
away for free, understandably considering the lack of quality and
development effort put forth for it.
