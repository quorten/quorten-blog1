This is an interesting coworking company.  So, you're wondering how 3D
technology can be applied more intensively in the business world?
Indeed, coworking spaces provides an avenue to apply this technology.
3D scanning and presenting 3D models of premises, using it as a means
to maintain such environments, things like that.

UPDATE 2020-07-01: Alas, after revisiting this subject over a year
later, it is clear that coworking spaces have their clear weakness in
common with all on-premises job sites: sharing a space in common is
not safe in cold and flu season, but especially not so in the midst of
a pandemic.  And this being a small company, rather than a larger one
in the coworking space, has ought to been hit pretty hard.  They
hadn't written a single new blog post since February 2020, and from
the looks of it there have been layoffs of long-time employees
there... relative to the fact that it is a young startup company.
