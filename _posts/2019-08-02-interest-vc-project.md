Interesting venture capital funding here.

Now, this sponsored project is really interesting.  Making human grade
edible food from cricket protein?  For the time being, humans aren't
quite there yet toward eating that kind of food, but for the sake of
creating dog food, this is really a blast!  Pets and owners alike
really like it compared to the alternative protein-rich food dogfood
sources.
