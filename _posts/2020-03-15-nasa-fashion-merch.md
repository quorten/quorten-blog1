I came upon this website that combines to great things together:
geekiness and fashion.  Yes, this is really what I was looking for...
it's hard to find interest in both categories in the same time.  The
author of this website was invited to the NASA Social and has an
interest in space science.

So, what the "shop this look" at the end of each post?  Basically, the
author keeps an inventory of all the clothing she wears in the
pictures of the blog post, and then has links to all of it at the end,
available for commercial purchase... sometimes.  Looks like this is
all contingent on mass production, so the more specialized and popular
items are often found to be out of stock, especially on older posts.

Also space related: countdown cancellation?  Yes, that's the reason
for countdowns on rocket launches, to check everything over and cancel
if something is found wrong.  Rocket launches are still challenging
business.
