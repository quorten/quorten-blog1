Oh yeah!  Don't forget.  So, an important observation on 3D objects.
I've noticed that many 3D objects in the manufactured world are very
much the same in physical structure, differing only in color and
surface printing.  Yeah, this makes sense given the limitations of
current manufacturing technology.  But what else does it mean?  It
also means that the process of digitizing a 3D object is much simpler.
In today's world, all one needs to do is 3D scan a control group of 3D
objects, and then 2D photographs of additional objects can be
automatically matched against their 3D counterparts, and the remaining
texture can be applied by simple matching means.  Done, mass 3D
problem solved.

But of course, it also begs a question to think for the future.  In
the future, with 3D printing, will we perhaps have a larger diversity
in the world of industrial design?  Could it be the case that every
manufactured object is slightly different in 3D design detail from
every other?  Well, I don't know, this may be an interesting future to
come.
