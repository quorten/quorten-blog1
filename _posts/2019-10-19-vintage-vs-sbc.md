Many times, I am challenged by a fellow engineer to explain why you'd
want to do vintage computing rather than modern single-board
computers.  Thinking through this carefully, I have a rational
explanation.  Money talks.  When you use basic electronics skills to
make repairs to a vintage computer, you can easily estimate the
difference in asset value before and after the servicing.  Typically,
even the most basic of servicing will grow the asset value.

If you find out that you're not all that interested in playing with
the vintage hardware, you can sell it at a profit.  Alas, that alone
is a motivator to buy another vintage computer in need of repair,
practice your electronics skills, sell, and repeat.  Single board
computers, by contrast, require a much greater investment in
engineering design and manufacturing labor in order to get into any
market dynamic where a profit can be turned upon sale.
