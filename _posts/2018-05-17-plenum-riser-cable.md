Home network notes.

Important!  Two different types of in-wall cable: plenum cable,
designed to be run through ventilation ducts, and riser cable.  The
first has more stringent fire-code standards, the second less so but
still more stringent than ordinary stranded patch cable.

Also, plenum cable is required for schools and hospitals under all
circumstances.  So if you have a question of whether to buy both
plenum cable and riser cable, just go with plenum cable if there is
such a requirement.

  run beside a heat vent
