ELKS is the Embedded Linux Kernel Subset, it works on 16-bit
systems, right?  That is correct.

Interestingly, upon this revisit, I've found word of a new project,
`gcc-ia16`.  This is the successor of `bcc`, a version of GCC that
allows you to target 16-bit Intel x86 processors.  Interestingly,
FreeDOS is also using it.
