Want to 3D print metal objects on the cheap?  Unfortunately, no
"consumer-grade" "desktop" 3D printer is capable of doing this...  but
there is a close compromise that works under some circumstances.
Often times, in the case of decorative items, the use of metal serves
no essential purpose other than to be shiny in order to make the item
in question look pretty.  In this case, metal plating of any solid
substrate is good enough.  And, what better way to metal plate than by
electroforming?  Just paint a conductive carbon ink coating on the
surface of your 3D printed part, place it in a electrolyte bath, run
the electric current, swirl it around, and tada!  You've got a "metal"
object, as far as eyes are concerned.  To plate with arbitrary metals,
first electroform copper, then you can electroplate almost any metal
on top of that.  So the same could be said... with using a soldering
iron to deposit other metals onto the surface of copper, but that is
significantly labor intensive for objects of any appreciable size,
i.e. anything larger than the size of electrical solder joints.

Another point in hand... if your metal coating is thick enough and the
surface area large enough, you could even use metal-plated objects as
a reasonable electrical conductor for DIY electronics.  In particular,
the ne ultra achievement... you could 3D print your own surface board
substrate, then metal-plate the conductive traces on top.

more details on how to do this.
