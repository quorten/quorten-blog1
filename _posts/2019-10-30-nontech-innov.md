Somehow I wasn't fully conscious of this before, but nowadays I am
aware that holidays (and retirement) are where non-tech people slow
down in innovation.  School and work is where non-tech people are kept
in the loop with innovation.  By contrast, it is considered somewhat
normal for tech people to not take a break from innovation during the
holidays.  Off work, yeah, but off innovation, heck no.
