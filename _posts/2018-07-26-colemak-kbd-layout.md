So, you're wondering about the Colemak keyboard layout?  It's actually
not that esoteric, it's designed to be almost like QWERTY but with
only a few modifications.

And an interesting idea after reading about overlay keyboards.  So,
you want a keyboard where it is easy to change the printed letter
keycaps on demand?  Well, you can print sheets of paper and put them
on top, or you can re-arrange the keycaps when you have a removable
keycaps keyboard.

Now, here's my other own idea.  You can use a videoprojector to
project the keys onto the keyboard, then changing them in software is
easy and quick.
