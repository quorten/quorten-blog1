Yep, here we revisit the subject again on the economics of
open-source.  Nowadays, open-source is on a mixed position in the
business economics spectrum.  In some areas, more money than ever
before is going into the funding of upen-source development.  However,
for many, being under-funded still remains a reality.  Worse yet,
there are sometimes some very big corporate users who demand that the
maintainer fix a problem for them with urgency, but they are unwilling
to pay.  Here are a few articles discussing the subject, which I found
from Twitter, etc.
