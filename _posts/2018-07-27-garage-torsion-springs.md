Wondering about garage door torsion springs?  The second link in
particular is a great resource.

Garage door springs are normally manufactured to last for 10,000
cycles.  However, it is possible to have a _high cycle count
conversion_ on a stock garage door spring to bring it up to 20,000
cycles.  However, it's important to consider the relative life of the
other components, the bearings, the rollers, the track, the cable, the
torsion tube, and so on.  Also, if your garage does not have a steady
foundation, the shifting garage foundation can cause you trouble with
those other components going out of alignment and getting damaged at
an earlier date.  When that happens, excess stress is placed on the
garage door torsion spring, effectively reducing its lifetime.
Likewise, having an insulated garage to regulate the temperature
inside can improve the life of the garage door spring too: great
stress can be placed on the spring when used in the cold.

So, one thing to consider is that maybe only the best springs are
suited to the best built garages.

Finally, one last point.  Zinc galvanized springs or oil tempered
springs?  The zinc galvanized springs are resistant to rusting, but
that doesn't mean they necessarily last longer.  Most importantly,
although they look prettier, they can make a quite aggrevating noise
when they are in use.  Go with oil tempered springs or both (oil
tempered zinc galvanized springs?) if possible.
