Make your own film developer?  You can use coffee to do that.

So, although home-made film developer is promising, home-made film is
a bit more difficult.  Coating the film with the photosensitive
material is a bit more complicated, and getting the photosensitive
material?  You might have to buy that specially.

So in other words, the most expensive material in traditional
photography is the photosensitive material.  Finding a way to make
that material cheaper will make all of traditional photography
suddenly magically cheap.

Other, less promising sources.
