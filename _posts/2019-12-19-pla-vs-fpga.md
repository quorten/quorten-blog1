Programmable Logic Array (PLA) and FPGA.  They are both very similar
devices in concept, but what's the difference between them?  I think
it must be mostly in terms of complexity and scale.  Programmable
Logic Arrays are designed to only replace a small handful of NAND
gates on a circuit board, say 5 to 50, with a single chip.  An FPGA by
contrast is designed to have enough gates to implement a CPU, for
example.  To that end, an FPGA may also have built-in hardware
instantiations of common circuits like couners, adders, memory, and so
on.  Indeed, this is the stated difference.

At the high-end of programmable logic arrays are _complex_
programmable logic devices (CPLDs).
