Wow, this is finally a thing?  Yes it is, in Android and iOS, you can
read a Wi-Fi pasword via a QR code.  This allows you to use much
longer and randomly generaed Wi-Fi passwords with ease.
Unfortunately, there's still not a way to do this with laptops... but
presumably it's not as necessary there since you can plugin to the
wired network easier, correct?

Here's how to both generate the QR code and to read it.
