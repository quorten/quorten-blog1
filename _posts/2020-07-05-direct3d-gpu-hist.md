Wow, this is interesting.  The Direct3D team has been doing GPU
hardware testing for quite a while, and they needed access to a lot of
physical hardware to test across.  They decided to make a museum wall
of GPU history with all their hardware they had collected for testing.
And, guess what?  This blog article is written by, yours truly, Shawn
Hargreaves.
