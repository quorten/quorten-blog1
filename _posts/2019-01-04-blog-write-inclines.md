Sometimes, I feel like I really need to write some blog articles, but
there are other times when I go a while without writing blog articles.
Why is that?  When I don't feel inclined to write blog articles... is
when it feels like I'm reading excellent reference documentation and
am not learning fundamentally new concepts.  Just the specifics of an
symbolic interface.
