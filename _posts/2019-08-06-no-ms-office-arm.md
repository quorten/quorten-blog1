Do modern versions of Microsoft Office work on Windows 10 ARM?
Unfortunately, no.  If you want the full-featured product, you're
going to have to use that through x86 emulation.  However, if you're
okay with using only a restricted subset of Microsoft Office, then
there are special reduced versions that run native on ARM.
