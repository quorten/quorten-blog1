Wow, this New York Times article is really interesting.  Coronavirus
has taken the hardest employment hit on the lowest income workers and
the lowest hit on the highest income workers.  39% jobless earning
less than $50,000 annual salary, 20% jobless earning $50,000 and
above, and only 13% jobless earning more than $100,000.

Wow, this is really interesting, TSMC planning to build a new
fabrication facility in Arizona.  They could have picked anywhere in
the world to place it, and they decided Arizona was the most strategic
location.  The facility will utilize TSMCâ€™s 5-nanometer technology for
semiconductor wafer fabrication and have the capacity to produce
20,000 wafers per month.
