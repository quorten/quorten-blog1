So, there's been questions whether a band that calls itself Metallica
is the same one as such a band that existed many years before.  Well,
let's see if we can find their trademark registration.

Ah ha, there are many companies using the same trademark registration,
but in disparate industries.

"floor mats for vehicles and SUV mats"

"Headphones; magnets; mousepads; switchplates; video games;
downloadable ring tones, music, and electronic games via the Internet
and wireless devices; and downloadable audio files in the field of
music"

This is a really interesting article that I found about copyrights on
tatoos.  The laws are ambiguous as to the ownership of the tatoos, but
one thing is clear is that if there are questions, they should be
asked before the ink dries.  Well, before the tatoo is applied.

Oh, so is this the right trademark of that band?

So it looks like they are filing suits against other Metallica
trademarks, but not all of them.  It was safety gloves for that time.

"Cheap knockoff" bands have Metallica's seal of approval, so long as
they dub themselves as "tribute" bands.  After all, that's how
Metallica got started.  Unfortunately, Metallica found out that they
had an overzealous lawyer that sent a cease-and-desist letter without
consulting them or their management first.  Their response was a quick
rescind of that letter, and they've sent their attorney away for
"permanently ice fishing in Alaska."
