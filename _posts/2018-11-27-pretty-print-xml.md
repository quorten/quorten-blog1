Important!  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

How do you pretty print indent and format XML?  Yeah, I remember I
searched for this, but then I dropped it thinking it was just too
obvious.  But then I realize I had to search for it again.  So, I will
take a note of it too.  It's easy to do from a GNU/Linux command line
if you have `libxml` tools installed.

    xmllint --format file.xml
