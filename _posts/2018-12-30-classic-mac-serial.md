Okay, so for additional old Macintosh communications cables, namely
for means of serial communication with a Macintosh SE, I went
searching around on Digi-Key to see if I could find the parts to build
my own cable.  Indeed, I could, but it appears the Mini DIN-8 cable is
very short-stocked nowadays, and the only source I could find stocked
the cables in units of 100.  Okay, fine, so one way or another, I've
got to solder the connections.  My final verdict was to go back to
Amazon, find a cable with the correct connector ends but incorrect
internal wiring, break that open, and wire it up correctly on my own.

This is my pick.

This is what I've found on Digi-Key.  Unfortunately, the
manufacturer's original site is down as of 2018, so I had to find an
old copy of the specifications sheet from the Internet Archive Wayback
Machine.

F.Y.I., the DB-9 connector ends were plentiful on Digi-Key.  Of course
they have to be, as they were traditionally much more popular back in
their heyday too.
