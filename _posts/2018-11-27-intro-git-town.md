Important!  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

I've seen this before, but I didn't note it down.  Now I am reminded
of it again, so I will note it down.  Git Town is a front-end built on
top of Git designed to provide a more friendly workflow that is
similar to the typcial workflow that most teams use with Git.  Unlike
Git-Flow, it does not impose a specific workflow upon people, but
merely provides tools tha make it easier to do a certain workflow.
