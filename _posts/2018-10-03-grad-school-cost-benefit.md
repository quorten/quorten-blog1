Interesting article.  Spot on about the question of going to grad
school.  Do a cost-benefit analysis.  Will the monetary spend to go to
grad school really be worth it for you?  What exactly are your
goals?  Have you thought of alternatives that will also achieve
your goals?

For example, suppose you want to be a doctor.  Going through medical
school will be the only way to get there, of course.  But, think about
the reason behind that decision: why do you want to be a doctor?
Suppose it's so that you can help other people.  Now, it turns out
that nurses also do a lot of what doctors do in that regard, plus it
doesn't come with the risk and cost of higher level education.

Also, I've got to start a new category on my blog around the subject
of "personal finance."  Well, let's call it that for starters.
