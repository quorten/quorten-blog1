Very interesting, back in 1983, Apple produced an Apple II gift
catalog that sold a variety of Apple II themed items.  One of them was
an Apple II jigsaw puzzle.  Steve Wozniak did not recall the puzzle
himself when being asked about it.  It is likely that it was mainly
Steve Jobs who was behind the idea of the Apple II gift catalog, who
was also at NeXT Computer when they produced the NeXT Gift Catalog.
