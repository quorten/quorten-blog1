Working with rolls of 36 exposures, and trying to use your 28 exposure
sleeves most efficiently?

```
36 = 3 * 3 * 2 * 2
28 = 7 * 4
```

8 extra, 2 rows extra.

Multiply by 3 = 6, 1 unused row.

```
36 * 3 = 108
28 * 4 = 112
Extra: 4
```

So, the solution.  For three rolls of 36 exposures, use 4 sleeves.
This will leave you with only 4 unused exposure positions in your
sleeves, or one row.  Under ideal conditions, of course.  If you cut
apart your own exposures, for sure you can get ideal conditions.

```
% Waste: 4 / 112 = 3.6%
```

Okay, now I'm looking for better binder solutions.  So, here's what
I've found.  Use a regular folder binder with a cardboard slipcase
appears to be the best solution.  Definitely make sure you get rings
that fit what you're working with, apparently the metric rings are
typically 4-ring.

This is a good article with tips on how to preserve colors
photographs.  It appears to be more centered around preserving prints
than preserving color film negatives.

This is an article with very interesting history on color photography.
Yep, indeed it was long possible, but labor intensive by the manual
combination methods.  Also, it's interesting that stereoscopic
photography has been around for a very long time but never really
became popular.  This trend continues even with VR headsets and 3D
glasses for LCD displays, for example.

Also, this is very interesting.  Medieval stained glass does not fade
because it contains nanoparticles that block UV light, but the
original craftspeople did not know that.  Matter of fact, the old
medieval recipes were used to make modern space equipment.

Here!  I've found the binders I'm looking for at National Camera
Exchange.  These are perfect!  They are "box binders" with sides that
close up to be dust-tight and light-tight.  Archival quality.  And,
they are by the same manufacturer who made the sleeves I've bought,
Print File, so fitting will not be an issue.

* Important!  Note that U.S. paper binders have a slightly different
  ring spacing than photo binders.  Photo sheets in U.S. paper binders
  will turn out to be a little bit too tight.

One caveat is that the Safe-T binders are a little bit too small for
my liking: 1 inch rings.  My preferred size is 1.5 inch rings, which
there is a variant available for.  Alas, it is not a "Safe-T" binder,
though.
