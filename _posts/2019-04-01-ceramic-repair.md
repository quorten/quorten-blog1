So, we know clearly that sodium silicate, a.k.a. water glass, can be
used to join clay pottery pieces togeher during the clay modeling
process.  Then the craft is fired in a ceramic kiln and it all becomes
permanent.  But, what about joining ceramic together that has already
been fired?

Oh yeah, right, you probably see the main motivation of
this... repairing broken ceramic.  Otherwise, it hardly makes sense
anywhere else.  Due to the stiffness of ceramic, if you want to join
two arbitrary pieces together, you would need clay filler material to
put in between.

The conventional wisdom from professional potters is that you cannot
join back together a broken ceramic craft, put it back in the kiln,
and make it whole again.  Why is this?  Ceramic undergoes permanent
changes once it is put in the kiln.  Moisture and permeability, the
important aspects of clay that make it stick together and make it easy
to stick other things to it, go away after the ceramic kiln firing
process.  Why does water glass work so well in the clay modeling
process?  Beyond being an excellent adhesive, the fact that it
penetrates the permeable clay surfaces it sticks to also makes it tend
to absorb into those surfaces to join the two into one.  But, such
cannot be the case with hardened ceramic, can it?

Well, let's hold that thought for a while.  First of all, I must state
some distinctions from a theoretic standpoint.  Firing ceramic in a
kiln is not quite an analog for scrambling an egg.  Carbon is a very
chemically active and reactive element, able easily operate in a
myriad number of different ways.  Silicon, by contrast, is much more
chemically inert.  It takes a lot more effort to get interesting
chemical properties out of silicon than it does for carbon, things
that are less likely to arise at random in nature.  Ceramic is
significantly silicon-based due to the role that silicon-based clay
minerals play in its construction.

So, a few points to tout about the theoretic feasibility of joining
ceramic pieces.

* Is the ceramic structure pure crystalline, or is it amorphous?
  Amorphous substances can be quite feasible to join in a seamless
  way.

* Is the ceramic vitrified so as to be non-porous at the cracks?  If
  it is not fully vitrified at the cracks, fusing the pieces back
  together can be feasible.  Notably, ceramic dishware is typically
  vitrified so that it is impermeable to water even without an enamel.

Conventional and popular ceramic repair techniques often times come
down to using carbon-based binders such as epoxy.  This has the prime
disadvantage that carbon is not as chemically compatible with the
silicon-based ceramic, and that the various carbon-based binders will
render the craft no longer to be food safe, it it was originally food
safe.
