Okay, I'm still looking for Raspberry Pi NoIR camera filter.  What is
the spectral range of the Raspberry Pi NoIR v2 camera?  I have
information on the v1, but that was made by Sunny, not Sony.  Does the
v2 really have the same range and response characteristics?  Where is
the spec sheet for the camera?  Why isn't it linked from the site?

Hey, this is a very interesting and useful protective case for the
Raspberry Pi camera.  Heck, it might even be big enough to hold the
Raspberry Pi Zero with batteries!

Okay, so apparently, the reason why the spec sheet isn't linked from
the site is because it was never provided to Raspberry Pi Foundation
by the manufacturer, so I'm told is the case with the v1 NoIR camera
and might also be the case with the v2 NoIR camera.

Oh, but this is a particularly interesting quote from the forum:
