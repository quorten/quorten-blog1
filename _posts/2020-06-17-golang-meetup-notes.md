Here are yet more Golang Meetup notes... sort of.

Here we have yet another gigantic DDoS attack that have happened on
the Internet in recent times.  You'd think by now we'd be better about
mitigating these kinds of things in a much better way, but, well,
they're still happening, and our mitigation techniques have not really
improved.

What was the source vulnerability that was exploited?  CLDAP servers,
being run by companies as a more convenient and simpler LDAP for
various doodads.

Concourse build result visualization?  It's like Drone, but better.
Well, then I really have to check it out.

This is a related convenience library.

Oh, and the name of the game in this presentation?  Go COP, or new
name to be determined.  A great test sysstem for managing flaky tests
in a large Golang project, used by a particular team at Digital Ocean.
