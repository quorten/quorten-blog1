This is unfortunate.  Lavabit got closed down because the FBI demanded
that they have the private encryption keys, yet the owner refused to
give them full-access to all the accounts.  This was merely to chase
evidence after Edward Snowden.  So, rather than complying, the site
owner decided to shut down.
