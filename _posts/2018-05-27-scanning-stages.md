After some practice, I've come to consensus on the process of scanning
a collection of artificial, human-originated information into the
computer that principally is accessible by humans in a normal indoor
"room-sized" environment.  It is only a few simple steps.

1. Document the information environment as-is.  Your goal is to create
   some sort of coarse-grained image indicating generally how the
   unaltered environment appeared when you first found it.

2. Reorganize the environment around optimal archival preservation
   storage and digital library scanning principles, and document the
   new environment organization.  For example, like-sized papers
   should be stored together, all digital media storage disks/drives
   should be stored together, items should be sorted in chronological
   order, items should be easy and efficient to remove for scanning,
   etc.

    * Footnote: Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Papers
      should be stored horizontally, not vertically.

3. Perform restoration treatment.  For example, often times in the
   case of paper, there are sub-optimally archived items such as
   curled or crinkled papers that need to be flattened.  The best way
   to treat this is to store it in optimal orientation for at least a
   week.

4. Create high-quality scans from the newly optimized and restored
   collection.  Review the scanned material to check for poor scans or
   material that is missing a scan.

5. When feasible, maintain and preserve the original information
   objects so that they can be re-scanned at a later date.  The
   digital data you have on hand today is limited by the capacity of
   today's imaging and digital data storage technology.  Tomorrow's
   technology will always be much more promising than what you have
   today, and you could just as well want to rescan the original
   objects with the newer technology, provided that they are
   sufficiently preserved.

Does this process extend to information about natural environments?
In general, no.  Due to the fact that the _reorganization_ step is
invasive, this process may not be applicable on natural environments.
On the other hand, you could argue that sometimes artificial
intervention in natural environments can be helpful for conservation
or preservation.

In the discussion above, the steps described are limited to
"room-sized" environments, the kind that are easily habitable by
humans.  Can these concepts also be extended to the microscale?
Absolutely.  In that case, it is merely a difference of technology.
How about the mega-macroscale?  That is far less certain, as we have
very few technologies that are capable of operating in the
mega-macroscale.  In theory, if we had technology that could operate
in that scale too, it could also make sense.

Why doesn't everyone obey these rules?  When some people go dropping
objects, and other people go picking them up.  Well, we know the
answer to that... the moment you mention "shared culture," that's
where things trail off.  Nope, in general it can't be guaranteed.  But
sure, if everyone acted upon these rules, the world would have less
problems with loosing things that results in instigating increased
production of artificial human waste volume.

* Footnote: For example, for a container with food in it, the food
  might need to be thrown out but the container should be saved and
  documented.

So, this is why we have "object trackers," computer devices that
"report to" the owner.  Who owns this device?  In the ideal case, it
is only one person.  However, sometimes we can make an exception to
this assumption and assume that there exists a community of people
with a reasonably consistent shared culture so as to effectively act
as one "person," i.e. a company acting as a "legal person."

* Footnote: Of course, this doesn't work, for example, if the object
  in question gets thrown out and doesn't get retrieved before it gets
  destroyed in an incinerator.  Unskilled archivists, i.e. the vast
  majority of people, are particularly prone to doing this.

* This issue is similar to the reason why news reporters all have
  their own microphones up in front of the President of the United
  States.  Nobody trusts anyone else that their microphone will be the
  "true words" of the president.  Essentially, there is no "shared
  culture" that can enable a _modus operandi_ of only one microphone.

* Ownership is a very interesting question in relation to software
  code components.  A distro developer copies someone else's code, but
  they don't have the humanpower to maintain it, so although the
  original code keeps getting updated, the copy of the code gets
  stale.  The bottom line is that this phenomenon creates more
  opportunities for attackers to exercise exploits, regardless of who
  "owns" what.
