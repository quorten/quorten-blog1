So you want to scan a book quickly and cheaply?  Here's how to do it.
Open up the book and take pictures as you go through the book.  Every
10 pages, take a "side-photograph" of the book showing the shape of
the spine when the book is open.  You can later use the contour line
at the end of the page to uncurl the pages digitally inside the
computer.  Easy and fast, doesn't require 3D scan assist to do
uncurling.

* Then again, it might be even faster to create a system that does use
  3D scan assist to assess the page profile from the same camera view.
