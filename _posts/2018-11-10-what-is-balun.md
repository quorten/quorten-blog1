What is a balun?  It's a device to convert an electrical signal from
balanced differential signaling pairs to coaxial style signaling or
vice versa.  Oh, wow, that sounds really great.  So, you could use one
of those devices if you wanted to convert from RS-422 to RS-232, or
maybe even if you wanted to route Ethernet over coaxial, with the help
of some additional circuits.  Indeed, the balun is worth more
investigation on my side.
