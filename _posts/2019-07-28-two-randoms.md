Two random subjects to blog about, simply to have some interesting but
non-technical things on this blog too.

Beauty and the Geek was once a show, but it is now discontinued, as is
must be.  Although it was somewhat popular when it first started,
subsequent seasons had gradually sliding ratings, as did all
television shows on the CW station that aired/hosted it.
Nevertheless, the producers said this was a run that you can never be
sad about.

What are bail bonds?  Basically, it's a system that allows trial
inmates to get out on bail with a company behind them to provide
assurance that they will be back for their trial.  This assurance is
provided with the assistance of bounty hunters, should they fail to
come back on their own.  That's the reason why bail bonds don't exist
in most places of the world, due to bounty hunters being illegal.  The
most notable exception is the United States.
