Important!  Do not forget this method for copying files over if other
methods of file copying fail.

Use your existing MicroUSB phone cable to connect the Raspberry Pi to
the computer.  Set up the Raspberry Pi in "console USB gadget mode"
and use Kermit to copy the data across the console connection.
