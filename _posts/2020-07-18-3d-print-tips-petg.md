Here are some interesting and useful 3D printing tips on PotatoFi's
blog.  Flat steel sheets versus textured ones?  Textured ones work
well with printing PETG plastic, flat ones for PLA.

Here is an example of a nice printout using PETG plastic.  Also,
PrusaPrints.org is now competing to be a replacement for Thingiverse?
Yeah, a lot of politics, and unfortunate if we see the earlier one get
taken down, but at least that's a good thing to be aware of.

The textured plate surface results in very professional looking 3D
printed plastics, with that nice ground surface texturing that you see
in many commercial electronics plastic surfaces.

So, what is PETG plastic?  Is it similar to PET plastic?  Yes it is.
Awesome!  You can print with polyester terephthalate!  The "G" is for
"glycol modified," this chemistry modification mainly aims to lower
the melting point to make 3D printing easier.
