This is pretty interesting.  An libre open-source UV metering system.
It only meters ambient UV light levels, it does not provide you with
an image.  Hence it saves greatly on cost, in other words.  On the
other hand, it is still a fairly expensive gadget to purchase in
addition to a Raspberry Pi Zero.

New Raspberry Pi rival from Huawei?  Only a rival if you think $240 is
a rival price-point.
