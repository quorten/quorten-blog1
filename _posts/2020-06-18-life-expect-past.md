Interesting article about comparing human longevity versus life
expectancy between the past and the present.  Longevity apparently
hasn't changed very much, it's all in life expectancy: the hazards
that would cut human lives short in the old days were much greater.

Yes, intuitively I have generally believed this to be the case, and
that the correct way to interpret the general situation.
