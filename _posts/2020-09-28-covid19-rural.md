Interesting data here showing a spike in COVID-19 infections and
spreads among rural areas.

So, an interesting comment here, and I guess it looks like it is
confirmed if you look at the state boundaries.  If a state health
department doesn't have the means to test for COVID-19 to verify a
death was truly related to it, then they are instructed by the federal
government to just count all deaths as COVID-19 related.  So, that
inflates the numbers in some predominantly rural states in that
regard.
