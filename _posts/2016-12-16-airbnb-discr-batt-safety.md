Oh, interesting.  Hoverboards.  UL 2272 certification was created in
response to all the hoverboard hazards.  It certifies the safety of
the electrical and battery systems for a hoverboard.  Particularly
interesting is the language on the site that refers to "high energy
density batteries."  Indeed, these have become a new hazard similar to
the hazard of gasoline, only they are even more dangerous.
