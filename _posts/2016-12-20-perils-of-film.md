The perils of working with film.  Yeah, sometimes when you take the
pictures, they might not turn out.  But, what's most shocking.  There
were some times when Dad took the film to target to get it developed,
and when he got it back, _none_ of the pictures turned out due to poor
development.  "Hey, you did an awful job developing my film!"  "Too
bad, already developed."  "I demand a refund."  [Sorry, we're mafia.]

So, beyond the other inconveniences of handling film, that was another
issue at hand.
