This Digi-Key blog article has some really interesting takes on the
question of a messy desk for a design engineer.  The messy desk fits
the popular stereotype of the non-technical general public, but most
of the time it leads to worse productivity, especcially when dealing
with high-frequency circuits.  Nevertheless, there are a few notable
exceptions.  The legendary analog design engineer Jim Williams who
worked at Linear Technology was famously known for having a super
messy desk?  His response when asked about it?  He likes to work that
way, and besides, he found it discourages coworkers from "temporarily"
borrowing tools off of his desk.  Another interesting viewpoint on the
caveats of having a super clean and organized desk in the corporate
world, it can send subliminal messages to management that the
engineering team is "almost finished."

Oh, and the final thing in this article, it mentioned a quote from
Albert Einstein.  Paraphrasing, if a cluttered desk indicates a
cluttered mind, what does an empty desk indicate?
