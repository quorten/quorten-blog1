Important!  Raspberry Pi 3 notes.  So, the question I ask.  "Should I
get a 128 GB SD card for my new Raspberry Pi 3?"  The answer is "no."
For a disk of that size, you're better off with either a HDD or SSD.
Also, beware that SD cards > 32 GB tend to be formatted as exFAT
instead of FAT32, and the Raspberry Pi will not be able to boot off of
such a partition.  Such SD cards may not be worth the money, so it has
been put.  Also, there's the danger of fakes.

* UPDATE 2019-11-20: You can use a 128 GB SD card just fine with
  Raspberry Pi.  However, the noted performance and honesty caveats
  are still in play.

JJJ TODO LINK!!!
