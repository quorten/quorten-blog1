I really like my geometric integer arithmetic systems of linear
equation solver so far, it's just that the problem is that it can only
solve in up to three dimensions, the limit being that I don't know how
to compute cross products in n dimensions.  I know it should be
possible: a vector is a restriction to one dimension, so n - 1 vectors
in n dimensions should define the perpendicular vector to all of them.
And indeed, right in the introduction to the Wikipedia article on the
cross product, this is stated right there.  Now I just need to figure
out the details of the math solution that they presented.
