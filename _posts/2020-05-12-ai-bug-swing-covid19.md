Wow, this is interesting.  Some companies are having trouble with AI
algorithms being unable to adapt to the rapid swings observed because
of Coronavirus.  The cause?  Often times, AI is bought from an
external specialist who builds it, and the operator has no knowledge
on how to maintain it.  The models are only trained on somewhat bad
day scenarios, but not absolute disasters.  It therefore takes a data
scientist to intervene and connect algorithms with real-world events.
