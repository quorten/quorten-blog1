This is a great Digi-Key article on FPGAs that really helps to clear
up the basic terminology behind the hardware specifications when you
are shopping for a particular chip.

So, one thing that I must say about programmable logic devices.  When
should you use these versus a small soldered constellation of logic
ICs?  Here's my advice I'll put in.  If you only have a really small
and simple logic network, go with the ICs and wire soldering, because
ultimately this will be easier to debug if issues arise in the
"programming" of such a network: just check the wire connections.  On
the other hand, if you use a Programmable Logic Device (PLD), that
would make the soldering job easier, but if anything goes wrong with
the internal memory, then that's much harder to debug and diagnose.
Especially if the intent is to never reprogram the chip in the final
design and there are no programming connections to the CPU.  Which, of
course, for simple such networks, there isn't a need to reprogram.

So, yes, the point is that you should only use a PLD when the degree
of complexity really warrants it in order to save cost, save space,
have a clean wiring scheme, and so on.
