Interesting YouTube video where people are arguing over the spelling
of a specific vocalized word.  Yanny or Laurel?

Very interesting.  False phonemes heard when inconsistent visual and
auditory stimuli are heard, and the various physical and cultural
conditions that increase or decrease susceptibility.

Although when I listen to the clip, it seems more like differences in
pronunciation.
