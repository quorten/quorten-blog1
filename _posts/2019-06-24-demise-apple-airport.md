So, I've been thinking about what kinds of wireless access points I
would like to get to improve the home network in a mesh topology.  How
about an Apple AirPort wireless access point?  Those are (1) designed
by Apple to be user-friendly and also (2) they are designed to play
well when operating in a business network with central IT, so it would
be a good bet for me to get one of those to try it out for the needs
of one of my particular home network users.

Unfortunately, Apple has discontinued their AirPort series of routers
in 2018.  They'be decided they want to pull out of that area so they
can place their full company's focus on consumer electronics.  Now,
they sell and recommend the Linksys Velop mesh routing system in their
Apple Stores.

That's too bad.  During the heyday of Apple AirPort routers, they were
loved by tech geeks for their ability to support advanced
configuration while being easy to use.  It's sad to see it go away,
but 'tis the way the world is.
