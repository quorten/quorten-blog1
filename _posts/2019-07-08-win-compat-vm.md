So, I heard previously that the new Windows operating system used a
virtual machine for Windows Compatibility Mode.  What is that exactly?
How did Microsoft ever deal with the licensing?  _Was_ is the key
word.  Windows 7 previously included a full copy of a free license
Windows XP that was run in a virtual machine for Windows XP
Compatibility mode.  Yep, that's how Microsoft did it, they "cheated"
with the licensing to get their compatibility mode included in Windows
7.  Naturally, that feature was not carried on to the more modern
Windows 10.

It's a wonder it even made it into Windows 7... of course, as we all
realize, the idea was technically impossible for Microsoft to do with
Windows 98 due to the Java licensing settlement that forbid Microsoft
from ever again selling Windows 9x that included the unauthorized
JScript (Java) runtime.
