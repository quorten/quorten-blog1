Failed search.

Is there a device you can buy that can supply power to multiple 12 V
DC devices?  Maybe, but it's hard to find.

This is an interesting site.

This site has way too many advertisements.

UPDATE 2019-12-04: See my [next blog post]({{ site.baseurl
}}/blog/2018/05/13/pc-atx-psu-info) for the answer, which is simply
"yes" for low-current applications.
