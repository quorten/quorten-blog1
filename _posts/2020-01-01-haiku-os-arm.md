So much old software that I once used simply could not jump the gap
from Intel x86 to ARM.  What about Haiku?  I remember playing around
with that in an x86 virtual machine, but alas, I cannot bring those
x86 virtual machines with me.

But, lo and behold, apparently Haiku os **does** run in ARM!  Now I
just need to figure out how to set up a virtual machine of it on a
Raspberry Pi.  However, please note that they still say that it is
extremely unstable and experimental.

Okay, I was definitely speaking too soon.  Chances are that many of
the other libre operating systems also have an ARM port in the works.
