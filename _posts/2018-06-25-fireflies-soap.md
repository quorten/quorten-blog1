Communual bar soap is perfectly safe, as the soap environment is
naturally inhospitable to bacteria.  It can't lurk on the surface,
especially not after effective hand washing practices, and studies on
this have been conducted since 1965.  Also, bar soap comes in more
environmentally friendly packaging (paper/cardboard) than liquid soap
(plastic).  Unfortunately, the later generation is showing a
decreasing adoption of bar soap due to false fears of it harboring
germs, or it is simply less convenient.

Also, wondering why hand soap doesn't work so well for cleaning
objects and floors as it leaves a residue behind?  It was deliberately
designed to leave that residue, the assumption being that it is an
anti-bacterial protecting film.  The film might be tolerable on hand
surfaces, but it is absolutely despicable on the surfaces of inanimate
objects.
