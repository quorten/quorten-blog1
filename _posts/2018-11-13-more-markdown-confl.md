Previously, I've discussed methods on using Markdown to Confluence
generators, one in Groovy, another in Golang.  Alternatively, you can
use a Markdown plugin for Confluence that will display Markdown inline
from an external URL reference.

Basically this is the only zero-cost plugin.  Also, it has a lot more
users than the expensive ones, so it must be better due to the higher
momentum the larger user community garners.
