This is an interesting explanation for why software managers have a
tendency to undervalue software architecture quality.  In most areas
of life, better quality simply means more expense for an object that
otherwise serves the same functional purpose.  So, with software
architecture, so instead of spending money on improving the quality,
you can instead use a cheaper architecture that will save you money
that you can spend on more features, right?  Wrong.  Worse
architecture quality slows down the rate that new features can be
added, so actually the payoff doesn't justify itself, except over the
very very short term.

In other words, this oft-repeated internal dialog and capstone phrase
I think to myself in regard to DSLR camera technology also applies
equally well to the discussion of software architecture.

> "It pays because it's cheaper."
>
> "It's cheaper?  Cheaper not better."

The point here is quite obvious to DSLR affectionados.  You might
think you're saving money in the short term when you buy cheaper
equipment, but pretty soon, you'll realize that you're working slower
using the cheaper, lower-quality equipment, and in addition to the
fact that it keeps breaking down and you have to keep buying new
cheaper replacements, pretty soon you realized you would have saved a
lot of time and money by buying the higher-quality, more expensive
equipment.

Alas, despite the obviousness of this explanation and analogy with
(D)SLR camera equipment, somehow this is something that most software
managers don't understand, probably because in today's world, most
software managers (and therefore software developers) work inside the
consumer technology sector.  Seriously, what other consumer technology
can you escribe the "cheaper not better" rhetoric to?  Software is the
lone wolf in this regard.
