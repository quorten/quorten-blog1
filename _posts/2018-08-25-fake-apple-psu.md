Interesting.  When searching around for power supplies for the
Raspberry Pi, I found this Hackaday article about fake Apple power
supplies causing Raspberry Pi board failures.  Watch out.  As it
seems, virtually every single hardware component involved in the
smartphone supply chain has a higher risk of fakes and counterfeits
than electronics used in other applications.  Of course, because
smartphones are the biggest market: if the con artists are going to
steal from people, they might as well steal from the biggest market.

That being said, if you have a colleague with a spare Apple 5W power
supply sitting around on their desk unused, make sure you go for those
first before you try buying.  Chances are you'll get higher quality
out of that than buying off the Internet.  Or, try to find one of
those doodads in a local store like Walmart.

Also, I found this interesting article about the internals of the
Raspberry Pi PoE Ethernet jack.  It has integrated transformers that
can be repurposed for radio transmission circuits.  Keep that in mind
if you have old Ethernet devices around.
