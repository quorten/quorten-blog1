Once upon a time, there were Lego Quatros that were twice as big as
Duplos and 4 times the size of regular Lego bricks.  They got
discontinued from the market.  Wikipedia didn't really have much
information on it, though.

Interesting, Lego Friends is a reboot of one of their earlier
girl-themed lines, with a much bigger marketing push, and it turned
out to be much more successful in sales and growing the market for
Legos, which was previously still stuck at 90% boys despite the
earlier girl-themed lines.
