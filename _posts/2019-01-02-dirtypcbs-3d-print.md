So, the DirtyPCBs website.  I better try visiting it to see what it's
all about.  Indeed, an impressive surprise awaited me!  The DirtyPCBs
website also offers SLA 3D printing.  Note that DirtyPCBs does all its
manufacturing in China, which is probably further away from you than
you may like for custom, small-run manufacturing.  Payment on the site
is simply via PayPal.  No need to create an account on the website
before you can place orders, I believe.
