Okay, I've seen the subject in a few random ads, now time to link to
the articles.  Flip-phones are making a comback... no, it's a
question, are flip-phones making a comeback?  Maybe, this is the new
generation of "foldables" that use a flexible screen to give a single
large pane of glass that can be folded up to a smaller device that can
fit easier in your pocket.
