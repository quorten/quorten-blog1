Whoa!  Revisiting the Fisheye lens Wikipedia article, I see a Pentax
K-1 camera pictured with Fish-eye Takumar 11/18mm.  Now we're really
talking if we are seeing general-purpose Wikipedia articles depicting
the Pentax K-1 camera.

So let's go searching around for other information on that lens, if it
is indeed a jewel worth owning.

Ah, it's considered "low value" according to Pentax Forums.

Check out S-M-C or SMC 17/4 which is almost as small but has superior
optical performance.
