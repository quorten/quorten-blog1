So, about the other recommended PCB manufacturer for the ZeroPhone,
OSH Park.  DirtyPCBs is China-based, whereas OSH Park is USA-based.
Indeed, if you look at the OSH Park website, you can see that the
service is overall more geared toward professional commercial users,
and they may provide some nicer services that DirtyPCBs doesn't
provide.  Prices?  Prices appear to be about the same as DirtyPCBs,
and that being said, they are for sure more expensive than your
hand-made cardboard circuit board options.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  "Solder mask" is
effectively another name for "conformal coating" of a circuit board so
that stray conductive objects cannot short out the traces on the
board.  The second Wikipedia article is the article on "robotic pick
and place" machines for surface-mount devices.  Again, due to the cost
of setting up these machines, they are still generally only available
for larger production runs, and small runs of custom designs must be
done manually.
