MacTerminal had limitations in its handshaking support.  Hardware
handshake, and maybe support for no handshake.  Why?  This probably
would have stemmed from the use of the ROM serial driver rather than
the RAM serial driver.

Unfortunately, the Wikipedia article does not include information on
this detail, but I'm pretty sure I thought I read it from elsewhere.
