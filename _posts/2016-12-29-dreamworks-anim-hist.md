Okay, so now I'm wondering.  What about DreamWorks?  They have some
computer animation system they're using, but what is it?  They're
definitely much more elusive and less publicized than is the case with
Pixar, Industrial Light and Magic, Sony Pictures, and Disney.  Okay,
so let's turn to Wikipedia.  What does Wikipedia have to say?

20161229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks

Oh, remember, DreamWorks Animation, DWA.  By the way, the "SKG" does
**not** refer to any software graphics engines, it refers to Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, or **SKG** for short.
In fact, much of the software used for the computer animations came
from Pacific Data Images.  They were an early entrant into 3D computer
graphics, and they basically developed all of their own software
in-house.  Their main early business was making animated graphics to
decorate TV channels like NBC.  Some peculiarities that set Pacific
Data Images apart from many of the other companies was that they did
NOT lease supercomputers nor did they incur any debt.  Their growth
came entirely through profit.  They instead relied on technology
advances in low-cost computers to increase their capacities.  Also,
Pacific Data Images is one of the longest-lasting computer graphics
companies, unlike many of the others, and their entire operation went
smooth until their purchase by DreamWorks Animation, after which they
were affected by the turmoil of the larger company.

<!-- more -->

And about their software?  There was only one occasion upon which they
licensed it to an outside company.  Other than that, the software is
entirely developed in-house, it was never licensed or sold to outside
companies (except for their open-source contributions to OpenEXR).  So
there you go.  That's the lowdown on their software system, and yes,
that's the reason why their software seems so much more "obscure" than
that of Pixar or Industrial Light and Magic, because it is.  Those
other companies, of course, do participate in selling their software
such as RenderMan to third parties.

* So, in a sense, even before the advent of libre software computer
  graphics, the availability of a commercial product for sale on the
  open market for anyone who can pay the offer price was a
  considerable "advance" over the other alternative where the software
  is not even offered for sale, just the service.

* And, when I think about it, this has considerable implications to
  the availability, participation, and interoperability of standards
  in computer graphics.  The CAM companies aren't really participating
  because those realms of software development can often times be seen
  as their "secret competitive strategy," plus they also want to get
  vendor lock-in on their platform.  And for the animation and movie
  industry, well unfortunately we have something rather similar going
  on.  Rather than trying to share at a module level, the
  "traditional" practice is to phone in a company as a "service
  bureau" that does an animation job and produces a video sequence.
  No sharing of 3D assets, they're all custom-created by artists
  in-house.

  Yeah, so that's why 3D data exchange, though slightly better among
  artistic 3D computer graphics and animation software than CAM
  software, is still hampered and problematic.  The problem is that
  these industries traditionally just never really had a need to
  communicate their 3D data, at least from the way they were
  traditionally operated.

20161229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mireille_Soria

* Side note: It seems from the DreamWorks Animation article that
  Mireille Soria is someone important.  However, the Wikipedia article
  on Mireille Soria doesn't have very much information.

20161229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Data_Images

What about Big Idea?  Oh, they definitely buy their animation software
from other people.  A very small joint they are.  Well, no dice on the
Wikipedia article making mention of the software they use.

Now I'm wondering.  Family Home Entertainment?  Now that it was
brought up, let's see what Wikipedia has in store.

20161229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Home_Entertainment  
20161229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Gate_Entertainment  
20161229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_the_Lions

* Is Between the Lions releated to Lions Gate Entertainment at all?
  Nope, not the least bit.  Between the Lions came from WGBH, Shadow
  Projects, and Sirius Thinking Ltd.  Oh, and it is no longer in
  production anymore.  No, it didn't use computer graphics, it was
  actually all puppetry, I'm told.  Even for that stone lion and that
  computer mouse, Click.

    * Click can drag and drop objects out of books and websites?
      Really?  Come on!  I thought for sure at least some special
      effects in the show were done using computer graphics.  Okay,
      maybe some, maybe the Wikipedia article wasn't fully detailed on
      that point, but there you go.  Limitations with Wikipedia.

* Wait, could this be it?  Maybe it is.  Unfortunately, the Wikipedia
  article is not detailed enough.

20161230/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_animation  
20161230/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_%26_Son  
20161230/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_Hues_Studios  
20161230/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_%28film%29#Controversies

* Interesting.  Rhythm and Hues Studios had a frictional encounter
  with one of its clients such that Rhythm and Hues didn't get paid as
  much as they were expecting and had to file for Chapter 11
  Bankruptcy.  The articles above contain more information on the
  subject.  This was particularly due to the making of the Life of Pi
  film.

  Oh yeah, and I'd be interested in looking in that documentary on
  YouTube, but seriously, I'm in the middle of a data deluge right
  now, and I've got to do wrapup on taking notes on what I've been
  previously reading.

* You know, on DreamWorks Animation.  First, they started as Pacific
  Data Images, making computer-animated flying logos for television
  network stations.  Then, later on, they worked their way up to
  making feature-length animated films.  And then, even later on, when
  part of DreamWorks Animation, they had an effort to move diversity
  their revenue source beyond the high-risk movie business and into
  television series and other things like that.  Wow, how they swung
  up to the difficult rung of the ladder, then had to lower themselves
  a bit, after a hiatus of becoming almost dependent on feature-length
  animations for a revenue source.

  Also, it's interesting to see how much DreamWorks Animation split
  off from DreamWorks Pictures (DreamWorks SKG).  Oh yeah, and
  DreamWorks Animation owns the DreamWorks trademarks.  Oh yeah, and
  the more formal name for DreamWorks Animation is DreamWorks
  Animation SKG.

* Yeah, one last thing.  I was wondering about NBCUniversal, so here
  is the Wikipedia article on them.  Wow, they sure do have a lot of
  subsidiaries, as is shown at the bottom of the article.

  20170107/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal

  Yeah, seriously, this makes me wonder.  Is our sole remedy nowadays
  for media to buy out the owners and own the rights to the media
  exclusively?  It is no longer possible for public domain to be a
  useful means of media acquisition and distribution?  This really
  makes me wonder.

  Yeah, because if that is really true, that would mean that my public
  domain 3D modeling and animation efforts would be in direct
  competition to these big media company's interests, and they would
  want nothing to do with it.  Yeah, that would indeed be unfortunate,
  but it could just as well be a reality.

  So I guess NBCUniversal may be the new Disney, and eventually, we'll
  have as much controversy writings against them as we do against
  Disney.  Then we'll have to start all over again.  Well, look,
  here's my point.  It's okay to have a past history of controversy,
  so long as they address the concerns and get better.  It's just
  that, well, that really hasn't been the case with how Disney is
  being run.

Indeed, DreamWorks Animation got bought out (but they got spun off
once, then bought out), and so did Pacific Data Images.  And same with
Big Idea.  (Big Idea was bought by Classic Media, then Classic Media
was bought by DreamWorks Animation, then DreamWorks Animation was
bought by NBCUniversal.  Yeah, and we know that NBCUniversal is a
division of Comcast nowadays.)  But Rhythm and Hues Studios filed for
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, Family Home Entertainment, F.H.E., subsidiary
of Artisan Entertainment, got bought out by Lions.  Indeed, I'd be to
tempted to say that the turbulence of the animation industry and even
the broader movie industry is rather comparable to that of the video
game industry.  And this turbulence also shares its similarities with
the music industry.  Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern, aren't I?  I'd be
tempted to say that _all_ of these entertainment businesses face an
eminent risk to going out of business, totally disproportional to that
of other business sectors.  Then again, the computer and software
technology professions face similar turmoils too, even though they are
selling important tools and technologies to reliable business sectors.

I think it's important to study the history of the companies in the
entertainment industry and how tumultuous things are.  Yeah, that
really helps provide a lot of context, you know.  So that people don't
get the wrong idea.  Then again, despite that being a "good idea,"
sure, I think we know which one is more entertaining.  Oh really?
Come on, I think I can easily make the study of business history
entertaining!  So, there you go.  It is entirely possible to present
this story, and in an entertaining way too.

So, I click through the link on Phil Vischer's blog about what
happened to Big Idea.

20161229/https://philvischer.com/news/what-happened-to-big-idea-part-1/

* Oh, that's really insightful.  Lyrick lost a few million dollars on
  Wishbone.  Well, I wasn't told of that on the Wikipedia article on
  Wishbone, just that the show was brought out of production.  Well,
  now I know better.  If I am wondering why something was discontinued
  in the media, sometimes it's not because the progenitors lost
  interest, it's because the progenitors lost too much money to
  continue any further.

* Oh, and commentary on "owned intellectual property" fictional
  characters.  Big Idea has found out that when working with Lyrick,
  they are treated as the "unloved stepchild."  From a one-hour
  conference marketing calls to Target, they would for example spend
  40 minutes talking about Barney and only 20 minutes talking about
  Vegie Tales.

* I didn't know they spent any money on the video marketing, I thought
  it was all word of mouth.  But the Jonah movie, yeah, I think I
  might have seen one commercial on television or something.

Ha!  So we do have a comment from one of the artists who worked for
Phil.  They're not all mad.  Well, at least I'm hoping the heartfelt
apology made it across.

In fact, this artist was a lighter who worked on Jonah!  Yeah, one of
the people who had to come in living in temporary housing, worked in
near-complete darkness for the sake of color fidelity, and started to
look like moles, according to Phil Vischer.

* What?  tms.edu?  Is that even Catholic?  Christian?  Well,
  Christian.  Evangelical.

  Ah, typographical errors.  Common in the historic practice.  "Why?"
  you ask.  Oh you know the answer to that.  Because the incumbent
  established publishers could produce prettier books.  Even though
  there existed technological means to produce more accurate books,
  they tended not to look as pretty, so they never did gain traction
  among society.

In response, Ed Udell, Sr. wrote:

I didn't try to read all the comments.  Oh, come on, are you saying
you're not even going to fully read this article?  Hey!  Come on, you
know, those Wikipedians are definitely right when they say Cyberspace
is an infinite accordion, and unfortunately if you try to traverse the
infinite accordion in full, that can have serious negative effects on
your productivity.  Yes, that is in fact truly the way the real world
is, and I am greatful for the fact that our modern-day computers are
now capable of storing enough information to provide a pervasive and
immersive, large and complex experience similar to that one
experiences from the real world.

Now, that being said, we have to end up admitting to the contrary too
when working with computers, that because computers are now capable of
providing such a realistic presentation of information, we should not
try to traverse it fully, just as we don't attempt to do everything in
the real world.  Yeah, I know, it's hard, especially because it really
straddles the boundary between the two, but that's the way things have
to be.

Okay, but anyways, now for my own comment.  Not posted to the website,
of course.  Heck, I never know where to sort information.  Were this
being done on the Internet, a ping-back from my blog would make sense,
I guess.

I didn't read all the comments previously posted on this article, so
my own comment might be a little bit repetitive, but here's what I
wanted to say.  I'm glad you gave the heartfelt apology.  I sure hope
the message got out to the artists who were mad at you.  One thing
that was particularly striking to me when reading the pages was the
decision point for taking the loan out of the bank.  The natural
response that was striking me when reading it was "No, no!  Turn it
down!  It's asking for too much," but understandably, there were a lot
of other things you were taking into consideration too such as the
current employment at the company and the future of the company.
Other commenters have questioned whether you actually needed to
apologize, but I think the apology was well deserved, as there was a
lack of fulfillment of the original goals.  (Although, yes, an apology
could be well-deserved from the other management too.)

Indeed, we did get at least one comment from one of the artists who
worked for you (davemjordan).  Another thing I have to comment, as
most have commented here, is the perspective from those who were
enjoying Vegie Tales.  Actually, to be honest, I was in some sense
suspicious of the move to the Jonah movie.  "Wow, that's really
stretching it, how did they get ready to release a movie so quickly?"
is what I first thought when I saw mentions of the forthcoming Jonah
movie from the Vegie Tales VHS tapes.  But, I had to make a guess, if
they're saying they can do it, they must be ready.  Also, we happened
to get the Jonah movie on DVD, and I did in fact notice the shiny
labeling they used on the DVD cover, and I thought "Is that really
necessary?  I certainly would not have been able to print _that_ out
using my conventional inkjet printer."  But again, if they did it, it
must have been easily doable for them.  I was so surprised to find
that my "suspicions" were actually extremely relevant details that
were pertinent to issues keeping Big Idea running.  And wow, I didn't
even know that there was marketing for the Vegie Tales non-movie
videos!  I thought it was all word of mouth.  That's how we found out
about Vegie Tales.  Indeed, I have to say, "packaged goods' marketing
is definitely not a good way to try to market media.

Also, watching the later Vegie Tales videos, indeed they were
noticeably different, but at the same time, as many others have
commented here, I was not readily aware that Big Idea was bought out
at that point.

No, really, I'm wondering, what about DreamWorks Animation technology?

20161229/DuckDuckGo dreamworks animation technology inside  
untested/http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/insidedwa/

untested/http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/technology/  
20161229/http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/25/dragon-making-main/

Oh, here we have it.  So, for the article above, the old
modeling/animation software used by the animators was Emo, from the
1980s, but the new "reinvented" software that they are currently using
is Premo.  Apollo is the name of the their computer server and render
farm software.

* Yes, and this being in-house company software, well, it's not like
  it is something that the animators can bring with them when moving
  between different companies.  Something to think about.  Well, maybe
  nowadays, the software's sale is much more open.  I'd have to look
  more to find pout, but that is as much research on DreamWorks
  Animation as I can do for now.  I'll have to do more later.

Oh, and I like the infographic that they have in the article.  Just
saying, in case it may be a good idea to design a "good looking"
infographic.

20161229/http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/25/dragon-making-gallery/

Oh yeah, and their animators use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  There you
go, so they actually are high technology developers.

DreamWorks Animation has a research website?  Cool!

advancements that have improved the development of 3D animations.

And for posterity, because this is a graphics company, we better
include videos.

20161230/https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/rethinking-the-pipeline-dreamworks-animation-advances-the-art/

Ha!  So this one is interesting.  The problem of induced demand is at
work when it comes to making computer animated feature films.  Inside
DreamWorks Animation, Chief Technology Officer Ed Leonard quips this
as "Shrek's Law," due to the observation that with every later
generation of Shrek film, the total amount of computing power devoted
to rendering doubles.

* Yeah, unfortunate as it is, this is the driving factor in graphics
  even on the consumer desktop.  It is one of the reasons why consumer
  computing equipment, at least in the earlier heyday of computers,
  kept becoming rapidly obsolete.

Also, it's interesting that until recently, DreamWorks Animation's
rendering software ran mostly on the CPU, due to their warping
computations being on the CPU, being intensively needed for most
animated frames, and due to bandwidth limitations to the GPU.  Similar
statements were made about the physics system too.

20161230/http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/inside-dreamworks-animation/382988

That particular article seems to detail more of the side of the old
DreamWorks 2D animation studio.  Oh, here, on this end, the artists
were using commodity commercial tools.  There was lots of interesting
discussion on the various techniques they used for combining 2D and 3D
graphics and creating special effects.

* It seems there was a point in time after the merger where DreamWorks
  Animation had to spend some time in a decision-making process.
  Should they go forward, continuing to use their in-house system, or
  should they just switch to the industry standard tools?  They
  decided to continue their in-house development.

  I think one thing that makes DreamWorks Animation special is that
  they started out somewhat late compared to some of the other
  incumbants, but they ended up developing entirely their own graphics
  software system.  So, in other words, it's like they had to get up
  on their feet running to catch up with the more established players
  in the industry.  And, to this end, after reading these articles, I
  think they still are running.  If they keep up that momentum, it's
  conceivable to believe that DreamWorks Animation's own internal
  systems could far surpass those of the rest of the industry by a
  considerable margin.  Right now, if I had to make an estimate, I
  would say that DreamWorks Animation's system is comparable to that
  of the broader industry, but with a few niche advantages.  So, I
  guess I'm saying that one day, DreamWorks Animation might one day
  get up to the rank of "winner take all" advantages.

20161230/http://www.roadtovr.com/5-insights-new-vr-developers-dreamworks-animation-head-technology-product-development/

Oh, interesting article on VR.

* So wait, now I have to phrase up my own comments.  What are the
  advantages of 3D on the Internet?  Most particular is the case of
  buying specialized electronics and electronics adapters.  Often
  times, when working with electronics, you need to buy a part that is
  too highly specialized to expect to find at a local store, but at
  the same time, the problem with online shopping is that the 2D
  pictures, especially if they are provided by resellers, hardly
  provide any coverage of the object's surface, much less is the scale
  unambiguously indicated.  360 degree coverage is easy with 3D
  scanning, with some limitations of course.

  But what about scale?  Well, the most obvious way to make scale
  obvious is by comparison with an object of a known size, often times
  your own hands, sometimes a ruler.  Regardless, I think it should be
  obvious that at this point, augmented reality from a VR headset
  provides the most obvious intuition of object scale.

  But for now, given the continuing low industry adoption, we're just
  going to have to concede with the poor quality experience of online
  shopping, while also admitting that often online shopping is your
  only option for buying specialized parts.  Yeah, sure, there are
  in-physical options, it's just that they're much harder to come by
  in comparison to accessing an online store.

Okay, wait!  I could have used the side bar to continue the discussion
on DreamWorks Animation's technology.

20161230/http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/25/dragon-making-premo/

Wait.  This time, the software was made by Intel for DreamWorks
Animation, not by in-house hired software developers.

Oh hey, there are videos.  Better go note that for posterity, for the
fact that I didn't TODO watch them yet.

20161230/http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/25/dragon-making-visualization/

Oh wait, they actually do use Windows computers at some parts during
the process.

20161230/http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/25/dragon-making-director/

Wow, great quote.  DreamWorks Animation is entirely aware of the issue
of the "uncanny valley" throughout their entire course of animated
production, and they take conscious steps to avoid the issue, such as
styling the characters to be slightly more cartoonish.  Yes, very
interesting.

The "no movie is ever finished" quote was also interesting.  Okay,
that about wraps it up for the key quotes that I've extracted from
that article that were most interesting to me.  If you want the full
details, read the full article, of course.

Now, there were quite a lot more interesting quotes in this article
compared to the last.

Oh, but _this_ quote has ought to be one of my favorites.  Taking
artists and "forcing" them to work like CAD engineers.

Oh, again, the question was asked about how much the artists do on
paper or whether they have entirely transitioned to the digital
medium, and it was interesting to hear how the the transition was
described as a bit of a challenge.  Yeah, seriously, like _you don't
have to_ use a mouse and keyboard anymore, and you no longer have to
act like you are tweaking a spreadsheet.

But, I _really_ like this part, how the engineers worked in close
collaboration with the artists.  (Very much in a way... I'll leave the
rest to the real quote.)

> **Wallen:** One of the things that has allowed us to move so fast

Yeah, I guess you can very much say that is the whole point of
software development.  To be able to take this vision on how you want
to see people work, and then translate that into a reality, through
the use of computer software.  Afterward, it very much is like a
movie, but one that repeats billions of times over a course of many
decades, rather than one that becomes a "blockbuster hit" for a short
moment and then is forgotten into the history of society.

* Oh yeah, a side comment.  Looking at some of the rendered frames
  displayed in the article.  The textures and lighting have certainly
  gotten more realistic in computer animation in recent years.  That's
  all due to _much_ more powerful computers.

Yeah, and also the comment on their use of GPUs.  Again, they have
already discussed this in the earlier articles, but the GPUs are
mainly confined to interactive rendering being done on the artists'
workstations.  For the cinema-quality renders, CPUs do most of the
computational burden, and again, this is due to data bandwidth
requirements for things like morphing, but also, in addition, it is
due to the advanced features of the x86 architecture such as virtual
memory that cause distributed rendering to be much easier to
implement.  Oh yeah, now that's a really cool idea.  So it's like you
implement one big huge virtual filesystem that whenever there is a
page fault, rather than grabbing a page of memory from disk, you grab
it from a cloud computing resource.

Oh, but this is the big one!  DreamWorks Animation uses Red Hat
Enterprise Linux.  Yep, _not_ Windows!  Okay, yeah, fine, they have
some software that only works on Windows, so that have Windows
computers setup just to run that software, but the main drag is
GNU/Linux.  Okay, so why is this?  What is there explanation for doing
this?

> **VB: How long has Dreamworks been on Linux?**

Oh, so that's what happened.  Yeah, they were all on Silicon Graphics
and IRIX workstations just like everyone else in the early computer
graphics industry, but then when the aerospace industry pulled out to
move to commercial-off-the-shelf, that was "basically the end" of
Silicon Graphics, so they had to look elsewhere.  Naturally, they
would choose some sort of Unix environment, and it was HP who
particularly recommended GNU/Linux.  A "new technological
development," I must say.  In some ways yes, in other ways no.

More commentary on the art style.

Oh, okay, so that's very interesting.  What we are being told, okay,
what I am being affirmed on that I kind of already knew earlier, that
it is not the issue of being able to make still renders that look
photorealistic, it is the issue of being able to get realistic
animation curves.  For that, we can't quite do a good enough job to
create believable realism in our virtual animated characters.

One more thing.  In the end of their article, they talk about how well
their unified enterprise development system is and how that is one of
their strengths.  Elsewhere, even within the company, they are heavily
segmented across different technologies.  Actually, it took a little
while for DreamWorks Animation to get from where they started to where
they are now, but now that they are there, they don't want to go back.

Honestly, I must say, this is the fundamental goal of open-source
software.  Libre software, I want to say.  The goal is to get
everyone, even across company boundaries, to be able to standardize on
using the software as if it were their own homegrown software, but
also contribute back fixes to upstream and pull in fixes that upstream
merges.  Yeah, so although DreamWorks Animation may have a pretty
impressive system for "inside the company," I would like to see
something even more impressive, something that carries those same
qualities and features outside the company, and even across companies.

Of course, that is easier said than done.

* Oh, the ending.  That's it?  Well, the last text on this last
  article seemed a little bit choppy.  Unfortunately, it doesn't bring
  a good feeling of conclusion when you get to the end.  This is a
  problem on the side of VentureBeat when reporting the article,
  nothing to do with how those being interviewed responded.  Well,
  maybe it's not just me, but they ended up making the same mistakes
  that my English teachers pointed out in my own writings.  Not to say
  that this is the correct way to do writing in tech.  Oh, no, far
  from that.

----------

So, again, to reiterate this.  As is said in this part of the article.

Yeah, wow, so that's actually a lot of information on DreamWorks
Animation.  I think I've seen enough, I don't need to go traverse the
"untested" links that I have noted above, my "appetite" for
information on DreamWorks Animation has been filled.  I think I seem
to really understand them as a company now.

Well, this is what you were saying about DreamWorks Animation going
into this research effort.  Yeah, we hear a lot about Disney, Pixar,
and Industrial Light & Magic in the computer graphics literature, but
we don't hear much about DreamWorks Animation, do we?  Yet, at the
same time, I think about the kinds of movies that I've watched and who
made them, and it turns out that quite a bit of the movies that I've
either watched myself or have heard of have been coming out of
DreamWorks Animation.  So what gives?  Is it just me, or is it
actually the case that although those other companies involved in
computer graphics get more press coverage, DreamWorks Animation may
actually be grossing more revenue than them.  Well, after all of my
reading and such on DreamWorks Animation, I can attest that one of the
main reasons why they do not get as much press coverage in the field
of computer graphics technology is because traditionally, their
animation software system was completely a trade-secret, in-house
developed software product, only once historically being sold someone
outside the company.  So that explains the reason why you don't hear
much about them when studying computer graphics software.

On the other hand, DreamWorks Animation is indeed an innovator when it
comes to animation software, and they have published some research
papers on some of their in-house innovations, one of which,
feature-based morphing, is now found in widespread computer graphics
software.  So, despite the fact that using an in-house software system
creates a weakness in terms of publicity in the computer graphics
software community, on the other hand, as has been pointed out on the
series of articles on _How to Train your Dragon 2_, this is an
advantage in as far as it shows that by continuing to do so, the
company really has an impetus to not want to "sit on their laurels"
and keep making money with little effort.  Rather, they have a desire
to constantly improve their system so as to be able to provision their
animation artists with cutting-edge equipment.

"So you want to work at DreamWorks Animation?"  Well, note that in
order to reach this end, DreamWorks Animation actually enlists
partnerships with outside tech companies such as HP and Intel.  So,
effectively, if you want to work on the related technology, you might
want to instead be working at one of those companies.  Note that some
of the work being done for DreamWorks Animation is actually also more
general beyond graphics software, being reusable in many different
cloud computing applications.  So that's another thing to consider.
