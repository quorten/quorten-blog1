The Wikipedia article on 24-hour clocks?  Looking back at it, it
doesn't make much mention of the analog clock format used in modern
times.  After all, considering 24-hour format is used in most
countries, surely there should be a widespread analog format.

Oh, and sure enough, knowing the way Wikipedia is, the 24-hour analog
clock format is covered in a different Wikipedia article.  And also,
there are 24-hour analog clocks for sale on Amazon, albeit rather
cheap ones that are not well-liked as the tend to break.
