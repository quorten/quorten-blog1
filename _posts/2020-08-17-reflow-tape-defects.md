I was looking for info on setting up standoffs for reflow solder, but
I didn't really find anything.  One interesting thing that I found,
you can solder surface-mount standoffs directly to your board, and
there is high-temperature tape that you can use for securing
components during reflow soldering, called Kapton tape.

ANother interesting and informative article I've found, common causes
of reflow soldering defects.  Good thing I haven't yet seen any of
these issues in my experience of reflow soldering, but my solder paste
is still pretty fresh.
