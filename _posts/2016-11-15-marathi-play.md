So, here we go playing around with Marathi language typing.  There are
two methods of inputting the Devanagari characters used to spell out
Marathi language.  One method is the one key per character method.  In
today's world, that method is not very popular, but historically it
was the only method that worked with typewriters.  By contrast, in
today's world, an input method editor (IME) is preferred that works by
taking in a Latin character phonetic spelling of the words and
translating them to their Devanagari characters.

N.B. Baakarwadi is a type of food that is like spiced mini dumpling
rolls.
