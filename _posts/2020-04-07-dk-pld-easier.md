Here is a great Digi-Key blog article about the futre of programmable
logic design, and evaluating the problem that current programmable
logic systems make programming more complicated than it should be for
setting up simple logic circuits.  It also introduces some existing
software solutions that can simplify programmable logic design.

Also, another interesting fact that this article points out is that
there are 8-bit microcontrollers are the majority of microcontrollers
sold, both in customer count and in number of units sold.
