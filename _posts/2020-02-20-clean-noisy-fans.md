Just a quick note here.  I've had a USB mouse with an "air flow fan"
to get air conditioning to your hand when it is on it, but I was
having trouble that the fan was being noisy.  As part of a repair for
fixing its frayed USB cable due to my fault of bending it too sharply
at the mouse-side, I opened up the mouse and found out that the
sticker on the fan came loose.  Well, no wonder why the fan was noisy!
That sticker dangling around could make quite a bit of noise I'd bet.
Also, there was quite a bit of dust around the fan, that's another
opportunity for cleaning.
