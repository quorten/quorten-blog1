Out of the few times I've looked to buy an old book on Amazon, I see a
very high price listed to buy the book new.  Why is that?  Is it
really that they are doing print-on-demand for you to buy a new book?
No, absolutely that's not how it works.  The book really is out of
print, it's just that there are some professional book sellers who
have new-old-stock (NOS) books where they can still make a claim to
the book being "new."

So, here's where things get interesting and very specific to Amazon.
These large book sellers are primarily looking for a quick way to
empty their inventory, so they try to complete these sales as quickly
as possible.  Amazon provides this really nice AI-driven price-setting
automation scheme to streamline this process, taking into account
raising the price of rare books.  Also, Amazon makes it real easy for
third-party sellers to be listed together on a single prroduct page./

So, that's how the forces play together to show high prices to buy the
book new.  No, it is not really "new" as in newly manufactured in the
last few years, here "new" is solely applied as a legal _de jure_
term.

Another note, some small-time authors really hate the implications of
this Amazon system because it means that some folks who bought a copy
of an old book they didn't like and they wanted to remove from
publication...  yes, these folks can keep reselling their books on
Amazon, for really high prices, and they can never remove their book
from circulation.  Well, yes, I'd have to say, that's just too bad for
the authors if they don't like it, that's the nature of publication.
But yeah, you get the idea of the point I was trying to make, thinking
on the side of some authors who want to go the way of proprietary
publishing.

Wow, great deep dive into the costs of selling on Amazon.  This is the
reason why most Amazon merchandise sells for about $10.
