My overall process of installing GNU/Linux from being a first-time
learner and going up until now, keeping up with continuing software
updates.

1. Download the live CD installer image.

2. If this is your first time installing GNU/Linux on a computer,
   write the image out to a DVD disc.  If this is the second time and
   you're downloading a newer version but still unfamiliar with
   GNU/Linux, write it out to a flash drive, SD card, or similar.
   Migrate the contents of your flash drive to alternate storage if
   necessary.

3. If you've been through the run before and are very well
   experienced, convert live CD image into a live network boot image.

4. Walk-through the live CD installer to install GNU/Linux on your
   target computer.  Often times it helps to have more than one
   computer when working with GNU/Linux, or any new operating system
   for the first time.  Nowadays virtualization is a good substitute
   for having multiple computers if you do in fact have a single
   computer with enough memory to do the run-through.

5. Configure the package manager on your new computer to not delete
   cached packages.  This way you can save the local packages for
   quickly setting up a second and third computer.

6. To make the various steps in the overall process easier, before
   doing the overall process a second time, setup a second computer
   that can be used as a server for hosting pre-downloaded assets.

7. Make sure you download plenty of source code packages and build
   dependencies to make local development easy and fast, so should the
   need arise, you can even develop with ease to target outdated
   distro versions.
