While reading about the documentation of the Ruby `vcr` gem, I found
that one of their sponsors is Cheap Writing Services.  What do they
do?  Do they write tech documentation?  No, they write college term
papers for hire.  Wikipedia has an article on that.  Ah, yes, essay
mill.

The debate about essay mills.  Often times they are perfectly legal
from a legal standpoint, and they are only unethical from an academic
standpoint if the customer of the service submits the resulting work
for a grade.  The main exception of the legal/ethical divide is when
academics is mandated as part of a body of law.  Sometimes customers
of the service will merely request an outline or request that their
paper be proofread by the service, and all the writing in the
submitted work is still done by the student themself.
