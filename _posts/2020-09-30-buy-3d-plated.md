Can Shapeways electroform your plastic 3D printouts?  No, they cannot.
However, there are companies that specialize in doing this for 3D
prints, such as this one called RePliForm.  First they electroform
with copper, then they electroplate with nickel, that is their
standard process.  And I agree, it is a quite versatile one at that!

WSF (White Strong + Flexible) is the name of the preferred Shapeways
material.  But what is it really?  It is Polyamide 12, so yes, Nylon.
