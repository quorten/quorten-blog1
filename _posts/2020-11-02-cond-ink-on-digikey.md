Electric Paint, the carbon conductive by Bare Conductive, do I really
have to go to Amazon to buy it?  Well, searching assuming it is at
Digi-Key, I found it!  I've also found a selection of other good
chemicals in there, I'll just summarize for those.

* Other conductive inks, including Circuit Scribe, MG Chemicals,
  silver-based, copper-based, ones with curing acrylic overcoat, and
  so on.

* Solder mask that you can draw onto your printed circuit boards for
  repair.

* Conformal coating: silicone, acrylic, and others.

* Two-part conductive epoxies to use as an alternative to solder when
  low-temperature conductive bonding joins are required.

* Lithium grease for coating contacts on card edge electrical
  connectors, cleans oxidation off the surface, lubricates it, and
  also protects from future oxidation.  Though, I have to admit I'm
  not sure if card edge connectors are supposed to be lubricated
  electrical contacts.

Yeah, lots of great stuff being sold there in that category of
"Prototyping, Fabrication Products > Coating, Grease, Repair," it's
just not very well categorized.  Fortunately, there's only about 150
products, so you can manually eye through the list to see everything.
