Plastic bottles in the ocean?  Well, that was but only the blunt
observations of times past.  Now there are microplastics, little bits
of shredded plastics that have since had their time being whole in the
environment, and they are everywhere.  In the air, in the rain, in the
soil of protected national parks, in the oceans, washing back onto
land, washing down to deep sea vents.  Wind currents readily blow them
from one country to the next and take them all over the world.
They're in the arctic, probably from European blow-over.  Yeah, it's
known that they are there, but most of the plastics are heavily
degraded, no longer a recognizable manufactured synthetic form.  The
primary property of plastic, its hardiness, is exactly what makes it
such a persistent pollutant.  And alas, we don't know quite what the
environmental effect of these are, just that... there's no putting the
plastic back in the bottle.
