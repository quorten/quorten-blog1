* My desire for 3D printing?  What is that?  It is the embodiment of
  consciousness: having control and direction over the world and one's
  environment.  So, that's why.

* What do people really want?  Conscious force.  But they don't
  necessarily want to control _everything_ in the world, i.e. other
  people.  Mainly, they want "enough" conscious force.

    * In a highly constrained physical world, paradoxial.  The
      difference between mere intelligence and consciousness.  And,
      the lowest level, rote-mechanical simulation of the constraints.

* The nature of communication.  How when I was 4, I wish, wish, wish I
  could have on-demand access to the information.  The technology is
  available to do that now.

    * But, for many, it remains untapped potential.  Why?  Political
      reasons.  But ultimately, it remains a philosophical battle,
      war, over consciousness, the haves and have-nots.  A game of
      winners and losers.

    * Also, also the observed problems.  Especially among adults, and
      for communication aimed at adult readers, we have this problem
      with "fake news."  But, most importantly, fake technology news.
      People are afraid of new technologies?  That is a jealous
      privilege possessed by adults that children simply don't have
      access to.  Children don't get told about future technologies
      forthcoming because they are denied access to those information
      sources.  Rather, they see technology for what it is in the
      present.  Get in front of it, play around with it, and see what
      it can do.  You'll discover its strengths and weaknesses right
      away.

      I keep thinking about this when I think about the things I do in
      my free time.  What is delaying me from working on hobby
      projects where a substantial product is built?  Reading news
      from the Internet?  Why do I do this if I know it is not as
      useful or productive.

* Computational intelligence, simplest from hardest.  Mere simulation,
  intelligent analysis, consciousness.
