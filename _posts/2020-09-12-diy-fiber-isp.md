Very interesting.  Jared Mauch, Getting Fiber to my Town, became his
own ISP.  Connected directly to the nearest fiber Internet Exchange.

Particularly important was the lessons learned from the county
notification, stop-work order.  The conduits need a tracing wire run
through them, surveying and flagging right-of-way was required, and
communicating exactly when they're working.  Lots of good reasons.

And, now you know how the pros find utility cable that they mark down
on the ground with paint, they use an electric signal through that
tracing wire that I'm guessing effectively functions as an RF antenna,
then they can sense and match the signal strength.

How was the project funded?  Pre-payment of customers up front, to
help offset cost, willing to put in $5000 each.  Total construction
cost ended up running around $13,000, most of the cost being the
digging for the conduit (~$90,000).  Muach bought a Ditch Witch
directional digging machine manufactured in the '90s, borrowed a cable
plower from the local Wireless ISP, and built his own fiber blower to
run the fiber through the conduit.

Fiber splicing... yes it's actually quite comparable to the challenges
of punch-down termination of copper Ethernet cables.
