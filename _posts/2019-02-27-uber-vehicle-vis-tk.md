Now, this is interesting.  Uber released an open-source, web-based
autonomous vehicle visualization toolbox.  Again, technology-wise,
this is nothing new.  It's just that... unfortunately, due to the long
history of proprietary game software and in-house tooling in this
area, there has been traditionally very little code reuse between
companies and intended use cases.  So, to step around this, Uber had
to redevelop _all_ of this software from scratch.  Yuck, it's a
bummer, conceivably I can see how many hundreds of people's time has
effectively been wasted over the decades, but 'tis the nature of the
old order of proprietary software development.  The proprietary source
code is kept secret until the old companies are going out of business,
for lack of profitability due to being in the wrong sector of the
economy, at which point the original source code is lost and
destroyed.  Then, a new player has to rebuild it all from scratch.
