So, I was wondering about a quick checkup on the causes of latex
allergy.  Indeed, this is not caused due to the primary latex chemical
itself, but is caused due to an antigenic proteins found in natural
rubber latex, intended by the trees as a means to keep the bugs away.
Indeed, it does keep bugs away, but it also causes humans to tend to
develop allergic reactions from long-term exposure to natural rubber
latex.  Luckily, natural rubber latex can be processed to remove this,
and synthetic latex similar to the natural formulation need not
contain any of this at all.

Another interesting material sometimes touted as an alternative, and
general material to consider for chemical safety evaluation: Spandex.
Spandex is made from polyether-polyurea copolymer.  It looks like
Spandex might not contain any chemicals with 5-member or 6-member
carbon rings, so it could be that Spandex cannot easily transform into
endocrine disruptors.
