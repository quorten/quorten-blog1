So, you're wondering.  What exactly are the uses and differences
between wave soldering and reflow soldering?  Well, first of all, wave
soldering is typically used for through hole components, and reflow
soldering is typically used for surface mount devices.  Second, all
bets are off that you can mix and match both of these.  You can attach
surface mount devices using reflow soldering, and you can attach
through-hole devices using reflow soldering.  That being said, if you
want to attach surface-mount devices using soldering paste to a PCB at
home, you can do it with a low-end soldering pencil iron.  Simply use
the soldering iron to reflow the solder paste, or use conventional
solder directly if you really think you can do it.

Now, there are also some interesting tricks for desolering.  Sometimes
a hot air gun is used for desoldering.  For this, you might try to
substitute a blow dryer.  Another interesting technique is to use a
wire of Field's metal to wrap around a surface mount device to
distribute the heat, heat that wire up, and you'll be able to pull the
surface mount device right off, keeping both the device and the board
intact.
