Does Wikipedia have anything to say about Mysteries of the Nile?  The
National Geographic video production?  No.  On the other hand, there
is a totally different video production named Mystery of the Nile.
And there are some pretty interesting things about obelisks.
Particularly interesting is the unfinished obelisk, which shows key
details on the construction process and methodologies of obelisks.  It
was abandoned because it had cracks develop in it.
