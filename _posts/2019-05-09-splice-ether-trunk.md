Wondering how the best way to join solid-wire Ethernet cable segments
together is?  A special kind of punch-down junction block appears to
be the best way: Punch-down the two wire ends to the block to join
them into one.  You get the same speed you'd otherwise get from using
a port-based coupler and you don't need to do soldering.  In fact, you
probably shouldn't do soldering, mainly for the purpose of making
splices obvious, and the fact that doing so can cause larger speed
degradations.

Another thing to wonder about.  What is the best way to do
branching/trunking with conduit for Ethernet cabling?  Well, that's
not so clear of an answer, but here is some background information.
