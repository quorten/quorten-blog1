Wow, pretty interesting here.  500 sensors on the 35W bridge.  In some
sense not that many sensors for that size.  So, what do they measure?
Mainly, the bearing of individual parts of the bridge: the angle, the
displacement, things like that.  Overall the researchers studying the
information say its "pretty boring" as I would paraphrase it.  For
sure they haven't seen any concerning signs of failure.  Also, all
changes observed are very slow: it is rare to see any significant
change over the course of a week.  Therefore, the researchers can
concentrate on more subtle aspects, like which minor design decisions
work well and which ones did not work so well, so that future bridges
can be even better built.

Now wouldn't it be interesting if a similar system were installed to
monitor the studs and beams in a house when it was built?  Yeah, that
would be interesting, but chances are the picture would be even more
boring.  Why?  Well, in the case of the bridge, the expanding and
contracting happens mostly due to temperature changes.  However, in
the case of a house, thanks to climate control, there would be even
less thermal expansion and contraction observed, thus rendering the
data even more boring.  Suffice it to say, the climate control within
a home preserves it and increases its longevity, compared to bridges
that are full outdoor structures exposed directly to the harsh natural
climate.
