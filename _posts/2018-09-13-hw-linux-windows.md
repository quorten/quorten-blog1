Chat notes!

A Linux SOE would definitely allow for more hardware choices too, as
of 2018.  (Surprisingly that was even somewhat true 15 years ago,
although the mainstream pundits didn't fully realize it.)  Although,
an important point in hand is that even our current Windows SOEs don't
cover the full range of available Windows hardware.
