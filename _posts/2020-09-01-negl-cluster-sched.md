Wow, this is a very interesting Twitter thread about how a cluster job
scheduler in Sun's Grid Engine almost got lost to time because it
wasn't a fully finished feature, but by good fortune it was kept and
made public.  It was hiding out for 16 years.  The product of good
engineering almost got lost to management politics.
