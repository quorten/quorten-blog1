Aww, yes, now that I learned so much more about how capacitors are
used inside of electronics, and their tendency to leak and fail when
they get old, I am certain that some intermittent failure issues with
some of my mid-2000s-era computers are due to capacitor issues.  But,
why is it that I don't really have capacitor issues with my late 1980s
and late 1990s computers?  Surely, is it that I am still experiencing
the issues of defective "Chinese capacitors" to this day?  Well, looks
plausible.  The full time range of affected equipment is from 1999 to
2007.

Interesting that the "Chinese drywall" issue happened around the same
time frame.
