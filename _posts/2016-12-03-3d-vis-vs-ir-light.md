Important!

So, why do you develop prioritization of your 3D scanner using visible
light?  Here's the main reason why: resolution.  I've stated earlier
that the goal of my 3D scanning project is to produce a
_high-resolution, low cost_ 3D scanner.  And that's precisely what you
get by using visible light for the scanning.  Sure, you can also use
infrared laser light, it's just that getting a camera that can see
that is less convenient.  And sure, you could try using radar if you
wanted to, but due to the much longer wavelengths of light involved,
you wouldn't be able to get nearly as much resolution.  And sure, you
can also use sonar, but again, that comes with a problem of
resolution.  Ultrasound is a viable mechanism for high-resolution
scanning, but ultrasound equipment comes with the problem of higher
costs.

So infrared and visible light it shall be, and I will be primarily
concerned with working in the limits of these media and technology.
After all, if the primary purpose of the scanners is to produce
imagery comparable to that which you would see with the human eye,
there's no point in going above and beyond the diffraction-limited
resolution of red light when it comes to scanning resolution.  So,
that's another good thing.  We have practical limits on the maximum
scanning resolution that would ever be desired of our objects.
Diffraction-limited microscopic resolution, easy as that.  And,
surprisingly, you can get rather high resolutions using rather cheap
optics on the side of your red laser, leaving the optical complexity
to that of your camera.  And if you use a DSLR camera, you can also
get quality microscopic optics resolution with the right lenses.

The use of infrared light and cameras is mainly a strategic one.  Some
objects are opaque to infrared and transparent to visible, whereas
other are transparent to infrared and opaque to visible.  So, if you
do have the option to use infrared light, this provides you with
additional options for scanning the details of your objects.
