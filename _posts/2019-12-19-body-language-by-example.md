Now, this is a curious article to write.  Earlier, I've written a blog
article about body language.  Good body language versus bad body
language?  What are good examples?  Yeah, there are scripted examples
of good body language for giving speeches, but this is something
different.  These are examples of people who exhibit good body
language just out of habit of what they do.

The first one, this video made by Rachel Hollis when she was in the
middle of working a weekend.  Lots of body language cues, matter of
fact when the video plays without sound on LinkedIn you could infer
quite a number of things just by watching.
