Very interesting.  SteamOS, Valve Steam packaged up a customized
Debian distribution for their gaming platform.  So now GNU/Linux
operating system hosts is connected to a much larger market and
customer base.  Some games were also specially incentivized to be
compatible, to help grow the pool of available games.

Very interesting, cross-platform play for video games.  The idea that
you can play video games with people on other videoe game console
machines or computers.  The interesting point in hand?  PC players
have a tremendous advantage over console players because the keyboard
and mouse is faster and more accurate than joysticks for many games.
