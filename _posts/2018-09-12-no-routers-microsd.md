Now I'm looking for a router with internal MicroSD card storage?  Yes.
Because if I get one of those, that is basically just as good for my
home sever needs as running a separate Raspberry Pi B+.  Most
importantly, it saves energy by reducing the number of discrete
network equipment boards I must power.

From a libre software standpoint... the choices aren't great.
However, there may still be a decent possibility to reflash one of the
commercial offerings with libre software.  Worst case, you have a USB
port that you connect a USB storage device to.

My impressions at my search results so far is that such highly
integrated devices don't sell very well, mainly because they are
simply more expensive than the garden variety of routers and your
average consumer doesn't see why you would want mass storage in a
router.

Now, this is an interesting hack.  Turn a MicroSD card reader with
Wi-Fi embedded into a Wi-Fi router.

Let's keep searching a little bit more.

Indeed, the problem with routers that have is a marketing one.  "Why
mobile internet sticks have a microSD slot?"  Yes, that's an actual
question on a StackExchange site!  People simply don't understand why
the feature would be in their marketed Internet access device.
Manufacturers have the capability to add the feature, but sellers are
finding that actual sales are much lower than their expectations.
There's a lot of hardware products out on the market providing the
feature you're looking for, but it's obvious that market demand isn't
high enough for the manufacturers to justify supplying such devices.
