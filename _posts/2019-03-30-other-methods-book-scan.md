So, with all my progress in developing my own process for scanning
books by photographing pages with a DSLR camera and low-cost cardboard
armatures, surely someone else had done likewise.  Let's see what we
have out on the Internet for information.

Oh, this is an interesting find.  The main innovation here is that you
don't need a high-quality V-shaped stand to get good book scans.  You
can get by just fine by cutting a cardboard box at an angle.  Also,
you only need one half of the V.  What you can do with this is
approach book scanning by paging through twice and doing an even-odd
scan.

Beyond that, being that this appears to be quite an older writing,
there are other differences based of the trends of the times
technological capabilities.  For one, all of the resolutions involved
are lower, of course.  Also, all of the photos are being sourced as
JPEG photos from a point-and-shoot camera, of course because that was
the only thing that really made sense in the early 2000s.  So, this
means that all subsequent processing steps are lossy.  But if you''re
okay with that workflow, then ImageMagick is a great tool to use in
it.

Also, another useful project was mentioned: ScanTailor.  The project
is still up and well, it's GUI is written in Qt, which is good for
long-term sustainability rather than GTK+, and apparently it has even
been used by some libraries, submissions to Google Books, and
submissions to the Internet Archive.
