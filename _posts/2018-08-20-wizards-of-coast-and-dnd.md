Wizards of the Coast?  Oh, interesting.  They're the ones who
published Magic the Gathering, and they bought out the company that
made Dungeons and Dragons and are now the modern publisher of it.  Not
to mention, of course, they published Pokemon cards during its
earliest days.  Although I remember them having some of their own
retail stores, nowadays they no longer have any retail stores, they
are wholly a publisher/supplier.

Plus, they're a company that got their heyday in Washington state.

And this is also interesting.  Dungeons and Dragons created the Open
Game License for their gameplay system, allowing third parties to
create different game content that used the same gameplay mechanism.
Later on, it panned out and wasn't quite so popular, partly due to
misunderstandings on both party sides.
