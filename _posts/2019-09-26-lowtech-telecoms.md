Interesting random article from the StackExchange network.  How do you
perform long distance communication before electricity?  Lighthouses
are one method, but when you mention this, sound was another great way
of communication in ye olden days before cars, trains, factories, and
whatnot noised up the air and made in impractical to use sound to
communicate for more than a mile's distance.  Oh, how I long for a
world where there was not so much noise pollution from industrial
machinery and over-amplified sound.
