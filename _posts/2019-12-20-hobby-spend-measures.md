(1) Do you account for your hobby project time spend/investment?  (2)
Do you "bill" for the time or have a way of measuring the cost?  Or,
(3) do you measure the amortized cost?

The proper way to understand is this.  You can measure the **cost** of
everything in terms of real resources such as labor, time, energy,
materials, etc.  But generally, the actual cost is unknown due to
undetermined variables about how long particular tools last, and
therefore, waht is their corresponding cost share over the length of
their service life.

Also, there are market value dynamics: You can't do anything "for
free" without also implicitly influencing the market value.  But,
remember this.  Price is determined by market value.  At very minimum,
market value is determined by two parties: the seller and the buyer.

Funny thing I realized: In practice, personal electronics hobby
projects do in fact have a "market."  When you bust out your
electronics tools, you take on a different personality versus when
they are stowed away.  So, in essence, one person is providing a
good/service to another person, though in reality, these are merely
different personalities, or workflows, of a single person.

The point is this.  The buyer wants to be able to account for **all**
involved costs, their primary hope being to instill some sense of
reliability for the future.  Namely, can this same product be
reordered in the future, and at what cost?  This is true regardless of
who is paying for the individual costs, and regardless of what the
cost to themself is.

Then, you can look at the actual cost/payment breakdown and determine
where there is likely to be the greatest variability in costs.  That
is, when conditions are most likely to change, and how that will have
an effect on the costs.  Usually, for custom bespoke jobs, the effect
is to increase the cost for a second time through, simply because
matching custom resources are no longer as cheap and abundant as they
previously were when the project was performed years ago.  For
example, the fact that you may have been able to get one service "for
free" in the past, but now you have to pay someone else to get it in
the future.  So you can look at that, and determine what the cost
_should_ be based off of expected market values for similar services
that are more available from a more massive market.
