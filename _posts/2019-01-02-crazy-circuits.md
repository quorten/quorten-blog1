So, I happened to learn of this interesting third-party Lego product
from Twitter.  "Crazy circuits," yet another way of adding electronics
into Legos.  Indeed, the implementation and concepts brought forth are
very similar to the discontinued Lego 9 V Light & Sound products.  So,
that being said, there's a lesson that the old Lego company learned
that this new company doesn't yet realize, and what is that?
Electronic Legos are, by far and large, of greatest interest to adult
hobbyists, i.e. the backers of the Kickstarter project.  Sure, you can
expect to be able to sell to them, but don't over-sell the idea of
bringing electronics to younger children: be prepared for only a tiny
minority coming from this demographic.
