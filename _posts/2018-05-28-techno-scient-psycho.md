Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

Techno-scientific psychology.  The study of how the environments that
people live in affect what subset of all scientific knowledge is
actually contained within their head, and also how technology plays a
role in that.

Throughout all of human history, different people who lived in
different geographic environments had trouble from moving from one
environment to the next.  Why?  Of course, because their brains only
had the pertinent scientific knowledge for one environment.  Not until
their actions in their daily lives exercised a mental requirement for
scientific knowledge of another environment did those people start
learning the scientific principles that govern that environment.
Namely, that exercise was met through moving into the target
environment and living within it.

As it turns out, technology only causes a slight modification to this
equation.  No longer do you have to move to a particular environment
to experience particular conditions.  Rather, technology can bring
those new conditions toward you in your current environment.  This is
especially important with microscale and mega-macroscale environments.
The main example of "mega-macroscale" as I define it here are space
exploration.  For sure, it's totally impossible for humans to do
without technology.  So, the other thing that technology can do:
rather than needing to physically transform to an entirely different
being, technology can augment yourself to be able to work and live
inside inhospitable environments.

* Footnote: Only on the mega-macroscale, of course!  We know of
  nothing that can do likewise on the microscale.

A particularly relevant example that comes home in the professional
software engineering community: getting fat.  Whereas an hobbyist
might spent too little time a day continuously at a computer to think
that using a computer could make you fat, it's a reality for some
professional software engineers.  So, nowadays, many software
engineering colleagues will be well-versed in the science of fat
accumulation and what to do to control it.  Standing desks, walking
breaks, low-carbohydrate diets.  Heck, I personally wouldn't have
thought twice about including this in my predominantly hobby-related
blog had it not been for someone else writing an article in their
blog.  So here we go.

Oh, and another note from a colleague.  If you do a low-carb diet and
start breaking down fat fast, you might need to increase your salt
intake as the ketosis process requires more of it.
