So, it turns out that the decision on Banana Pi is a more complicated
one.  At second sight, it looks like Orange Pi might be better because
the prices are lower.  However, it turns out that Orange Pi has a host
of hardware problems of it own.  Even the later Banana Pi models have
a host of hardware problems.  The very earliest Banana Pi models are
really the only ones you would want to get.

And wait, there were signs of legal issues?  Well, no, looks like it
was just a legal dispute.  However, there is a Realtek development
board chipset that is problematic, it looks like.  However, I believe
that is not related to the Allwinner.

On the other hand, the Libre Computer Board has some pretty positive
customer reviews on Amazon.  So, as is typically the case, libre may
be the way to go.

So, this is your most recommended model of Banana Pi: Banana Pi M1.
Only the A20 chipset has SATA support built-in.  The newer models new
a dumbed-down USB bridge adapter.
