When typing numbers with unit, should there be a space or no space
between the units?  I have seen both conventions to varying degrees.
In general, it is more formal to type a space between units, ideally a
non-breaking space, with only a few exceptions, but many times in
conventional and informal use, numbers are typed without a space to
separate the units.
