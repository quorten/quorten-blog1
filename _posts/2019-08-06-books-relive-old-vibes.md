I happened to find this somewhat interesting, though maybe I shouldn't
have.  In the 1980s, yeah there was a lot of fiction about the
"action" genre where guns, shooting, and criminal cahses were part of
the plot.  Well, there is this modern author David Baldacci who
published a "Robie" book series in the same genre.  So, although the
literal lifestyle is getting quite antiquated, the fiction mythos
lives on.
