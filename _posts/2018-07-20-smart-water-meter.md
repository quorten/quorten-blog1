A good smart home water metering system is an analog coupled system.
Connected directly each water consumption endpoint is an analog
pressure meter with an analog electrical hookup for smart monitoring.
There can also be a similar analog flow meter.  Earlier I wrote about
using sound metering as a cheap way to monitor for events such as when
water faucets are running.  Why doesn't sound metering work?  It can
get false positives if someone is watching a video on a smartphone
with the sound of running water, nearby the faucets.

For the flow meter.  The flow meter can have an electrical output
where dynamo energy is generated.  Well, I should put it as _that_ is
how the flow meter monitoring works!
