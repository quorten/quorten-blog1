Why can cameras take longer exposures than the human eye?  Of course,
that's easy.  Because a camera passes every single pixel of data to
the general purpose computer chip it has onboard, then it can use
whatever programmed algorithm one likes to process that image.
Whereas, the human vision system has a mandatory fixed-purpose
structure sitting between the eyes and the conscious mind that only
features a limited range of processing functions.  This is why you
can't tell your brain to do a long exposure on an image, or even
better, to digitally refocus an image to compensate for your myopia or
hyperopia.  Nope, your brain can't do that.  The structures in your
brain are grown and wired in as-is, without allowing for
reprogrammability.  You need a computer if you want to do that.

Well, these are important for my inventory system too.  On describing
human vision.  Not fully developed until after 6 months of age from
birth.

Only recently are we talking about the resolution of the human retina
and its refresh rate.  Something that we humans can now relate to, now
that we have computers for which we know the specifications of.
Before the computer age, that was simply something humans didn't think
existed.  Of course there are no "pixels" in your eye, that would be
silly.  But now that we do have computer systems, we do start to call
into question how the features and capabilities of our body, on a
tech-specs level, compares with that of computers.

It's good to remember, that although general-purpose computer
technology certainly rides the wave of Moore's Law, multimedia
equipment has not progressed at nearly the same rate.  Over many many
years, this has led to the association of participatory presence in
the media being characteristic only intermittently among middle-class
citizens and substantially more often among upper-middle class
citizens.  Heavily biased and very seldom, so to speak.  Though at the
back end of the media spectrum, multimedia publication has been
apparent to all.  Nowadays, low-quality low cost multimedia equipment
is increasingly becoming available to the average person, and to some
extent the below average person.
