Further searching on Raspberry Pi NoIR filters.  If DuckDuckGo doesn't
give me good results, why don't I try Google?

Indeed, I'm getting some actual results now!

Only $3!  Much better than my previous $15 find!

UPDATE 2019-11-28: The AliExpress link is no longer valid, the
manufacturer discontinued the item.

Oh, so this is the story behind the included blue gel filter that
comes with the Raspberry Pi NoIR camera.

IR illuminators are probably designed for security cameras, thus
taking 12 V rather than 5 V.

Oh, Thingiverse!  Interesting, here.  Well, we have a design here that
also recommends the use of placing a zoon and manual-focus lens in
front of the Raspberry Pi NoIR camera.
