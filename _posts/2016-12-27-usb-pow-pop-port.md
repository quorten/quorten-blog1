Revisiting the Wikipedia USB article.  Wow, this is by far one of the
most important articles on Wikipedia.  It's also very important that I
can read the most up-to-date version of this article to know what's
going on with the latest USB technology in the market.  Like the
difference between Mini-A, Mini-B, Micro-A, and Micro-B USB
connectors.

By the way, the industry decided that Micro USB would be the gold
standard for charging all mobile devices.  Well, as of 2016.  Yeah, in
earlier eras, they previously used Mini USB, but now Mini USB is seen
as clearly to big and thick to be able to easily fit within modern
slim mobile devices.

Oh yeay, another important thing in the USB article was the
photographs of the USB power meters.  Yeah, that could be useful for
assessing whether the power supply of a USB device is working
properly.

Wow, PoweredUSB?  An early non-standard proprietary extension of the
USB standard for transferring larger amounts of power to connected
devices, very popular on NCR point-of-sale terminals.  It is being
largely supplanted by the modern USB charging specifications.

The USB decorations article turned out to not be that interesting,
unfortunately.  I was hoping for a more assorted coverage of the
various different kinds of USB decorations that exist.

Just as a side-note, the Nokia Pop-Port was not well liked, as it was
of a poor mechanical and electrical design.

Hey, let's take a look at the USB adapters article.  It was an awful
article.  Largely incomplete, and much is missing from a full
understanding of the specification and such.  USB and serial ports are
not synonyms in any remote sense.  USB is a bus, but serial
communication is point-to-point.
