Wow, reading into this article, it really gives me vibes of the other
Wired article about Ross (lastname I don't remember) of Silk Road.
And, well there's full circle here.  The main persona of the article
himself was also involved with Silk Road, though from the standpoint
of a younger, later-comer.  Any mention of Minecraft servers and
clickfraud on ads???  Oh, that was that later article about the
massive DDoS that came about as an evolved gamer corner thing.

So, who is this?  This is Marcus Hutchins, who on one side, was the
person who stopped WannaCry from ravaging across the entire world.
And, on the other, the person who years before that, participated in
writing the majority of a very nasty banking trojan.  The FBI caught
up a few years later, and then he was sentenced for his past crime.
Interesting, weighing the sentence terms in combination of the great
good he done after the crime.

Unlike the Silk Road villain Ross who vigorously denied and guilt for
his crimes, this guy truly wanted to confess and plead guilty for the
crimes he committed.  He was appalled by the fact that when he was
imprisoned awaiting trial, so many people came to support him by
creating a financial donation fund for his bail, under the guise that
he was innocent and the FBI was after the wrong person.  He deeply
wished that he could have been more upfront about his guilt earlier so
that so many people wouldn't have rushed to support him under the
guise that he was innocent.

At first I thought this was going to be a short article to summarize
for the sake of my own blog, but a long read for myself.  But, finally
coming to the conclusion of this article, I myself am also deeply
changed.  This, too, is something that was worthy of a longer summary
by me in my own blog.
