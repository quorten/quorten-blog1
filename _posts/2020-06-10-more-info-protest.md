National Guard after dealing with protesters?  Well, it was really a
negative experience for them.  Both they and the protesters having a
heavy bend toward young adulthood, often times they would see their
own friends and family members out protesting.  They were on one side,
their friends and family on the other.  And they would have insults
hurled at them.  They didn't like how they were told to tear-gas their
peers and fellow citizens of this country.  And many of them area
suffering great mental disturbance from their experience.

What does "defund the police" mean?  Here is an explanation.
Basically, it doesn't mean "no police" or "no money" for the police,
it means avoiding sending excessive funds toward the police.  Try to
keep them a limited monopoly, additional monetary investments should
be sent elsewhere.
