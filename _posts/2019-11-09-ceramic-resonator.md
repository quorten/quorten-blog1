Ceramic resonators?  Those are an alternative to quartz crystals.
Their main advantage is that they can be smaller and cheaper, but
their main disadvantage is that they are not as accurate as quartz
crystals.  So if you're wondering how the Raspberry Pi gets its clock
signal without a quartz crystal, well that is one way.  Actually,
looking at the schematics and reading more detail here, a quartz
crystal actually is used for the oscillator.
