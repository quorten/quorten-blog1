So, earlier just about half an hour ago, I decided to just look
around, play around, without doing anything really productive or
planned.  Wow, that was a great experience, I ended up taking some
photos of some old failed mini blinds due to a defective design,
useful for failure analysis and simply just plain artistic fun.

So, now I'm wondering about the question.  Why don't we play around
more often?  Is there information on the Internet about this?  Oh, yes
there is.  Wow, so here's the trick that I am told.  The good feeling
effects from playing have a lasting effect for after 24 hours of doing
so.  Yes, so it is not simply just a way to escape from work, but it
also makes work more productive in its own right.
