The days of big computers at home for leisure are over.  The world has
forever changed with the introduction of smartphones and tablets.  On
the other hand, you could argue that desired user applications haven't
changed that much.  Even back in 2004, it was not uncommon for my Dad
to ask to use the computer for a short time just to check E-mail, then
us kids could continue playing on the computer for the rest of the
time.  I'm sure the condition was exactly the same in hundreds of
thousands of other households with computers in them.  The point of
using a smartphone or tablet to check your E-mail is that the device
is _better suited_ for that purpose: You want a small, low-power,
cool, quiet, portable, hassle-free device to do a simple task like
checking your E-mail, yet that task requires a high-end computer.  A
smartphone almost fits this bill perfectly, although it still consumes
more power than would be ideal.

You can argue that the reason laptops became wildly popular as soon as
they became economic was for the same reason: people wanted a small
and simple device for doing small and simple tasks.  Well, I should
clarify this point: what seemed, _to the user_, to be a small and
simple task.  And to that end, the device in its own right needed to
be reasonably low-cost so that the purchase could also be small and
simple.

### Footnotes:

* Also, I've got to put this out.  I have a past habit of writing and
  saying "tablets and smartphones," because at one point that was the
  popular phrase in the media.  But I really need to emphasize this
  point.  Smartphone sales trump tablet sales by a significant margin.
  Yes, tablets have their use, but the bottom line is that smartphones
  are sold to virtually everyone, whereas tablets are a more
  discretionary purchase.
