So, you're wondering about humidity sensors?  Well, let's start by
going to Wikipedia to get some background information on relative
humidity.  Ah, interesting, the article mentions that a device for
measuring humidity is called a _hygrometer_.  And indeed, the
mechanisms of a hygrometer are very similar to some of your suspected
ideas.  One method may involve measuring the rate of static
electricity dissipation, other methods involve measuring capacitance
or resistance.
