Interesting article about the effects of exercise on your brain.
Sure, we know brain performance is generally improved after exercise,
but why?  A few reasons covered by the article in a nutshell.

* Brain waves increase in frequency, memory, attention, and
  information processing is stimulated.

* The visual cortex is more attentive to the world around you, and it
  can identify flickering lights at higher frequencies before the
  light appears to be steady.

* The brain increases its production of neurotransmitters during
  exercise, and shores them up for later use.

* Exercise stimulates growth in the brain that effectively makes it
  appear younger: more blood vessels, more pathways, etc.
