Raspberry Pi continued.  I've got my multi-card reader, and I've found
out that the TF slot is the MicroSD card reading slot.  Why is there
different names?  Well, it turns out that MicroSD was originally going
to be named T-Flash, except that T-Mobile sent a cease-and-desist
letter asserting that T-Mobile owns a trademark on T-(anything).  At
least that's what Wikipedia says, even though that particular sentence
is marked with [citation needed].
