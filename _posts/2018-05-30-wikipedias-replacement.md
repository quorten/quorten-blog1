I'm still looking for the next new replacement for Wikipedia.  Have we
found one?  Maybe, Everipedia.

With Wikipedia's growth of new editors and new articles waning, the
world looking for a new solution that can scale to larger domains.
Has anyone used Everipedia?  It looks like a much more promising
replacement as it is not as restricted as Wikipedia, yet it still has
a content-quality system built-in, although much of the existing
content that was copied from Wikipedia doesn't yet have as many
improvements as I would expect.

For example, the deleted Wikipedia article on Ulrich Drepper did not
get migrated to Everipedia.

But even Wikipedia has an article on Everipedia.

But the verdict?  For the time being, Everipedia is mainly focused on
pop culture and college student culture.  The other goals are
audacious, but they haven't yet panned out.  Also, Everipedia still
has only an English community; they have yet to expand to other
languages.

Okay, that's not quite the final verdict.  Everpedia has yet much more
detailed information on itself than Wikipedia.

Yikes, so that statement right there.  Perhaps its indicative of the
problem with poorly organized communities.  Well-organized communities
_can_ issue an apology, by contrast.  And, apologies are essential for
effective communication.

This article really states what Everipedia is all about.

Wow, this is a subject that actually has a top search result entry
from Everipedia.  Also, there are a ton of people of the exact same
name.

Everipedia hopes to reach 100 million articles some time in the
future.

Ha!  So this is interesting.  There's a Quora question asking how to
write a Wikipedia article that doesn't get deleted.  Wikipedia lists a
number of alterative places to put content.  So why don't they focus
on moving content rather than deleting it?  Yup, you've guess it: they
don't care to help.

Worthy of note is that Everipedia uses IPFS.  So yes, you get the
idea.  IPFS is really taking off fast.  CCN, by contrast, is doomed
for irrelevance.
