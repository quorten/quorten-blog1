Okay, so I have various projects where there were originally two
pieces of plastic, or a piece of plastic and silicone, "glued"
together, but I accidentally broke the brittle "glue" and now they
just won't stick together again.  I can see the remains of some sort
of yellow substance that was used to bind the two non-porous,
dissimilar materials together, but I can't tell what it is exactly.
If I had to give a guess, I'd say it's epoxy.  Indeed, in some cases,
it is.  In other cases, it is rubber cement.  Still other more
specialized cases use more specialized materials.

Well, taking a web search for gluing platistics together, I came to
this pretty good wiki How article.  Note that the hardest plastics to
glue together are polyethylene and polypropylene (low coefficient of
friction), some of the easiest are polystyrene (high coefficient of
friction).  "Poly cement" or "plastic cement" is the name of the game
for plastic glues.
