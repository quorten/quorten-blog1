Tool-assisted speedrun?  Interesting, the point here is to use
software tools to demo the otherwise impossible in video games,
possibly taking advantage of glitches that require too precise of
timing for humans to use while playing.

What does Wikipedia have to say about glitches?  Other than that they
are considered more benign than bugs, not much.  Both such terms can
be applied to physical electronic systems.  Of course, bugs are less
of a problem in modern-day electronics than they previously were.
