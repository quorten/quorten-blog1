Wow, this is... first of all, a viewpoint that I strongly disagree
with from a political standpoint.  But second, it nonetheless is a
factual observation of someone who has been within the unorganized
crowd that caused the Third Precinct police station to burn down in
Minneapolis.  As they claim, being an unorganized crowd with no
central leader or control was the key to causing this to happen.
Also, many of the locals indeed did want to break and loot things,
it's not like all the locals were siding on the side of peaceful
protests.
