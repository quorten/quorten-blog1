SparkFun?  How did they choose that name?  What does Wikipedia have to
say about that?  Well, basically, the "spark" came about due to some
of the founders testing a development board that had sparks flying off
of it, and fun?  "Because it's fun!  Why should someone have to
explain fun?"  The company's self-stated aim is to put the fun back
into learning electronics... unlike "double-E" (Electrical
Engineering) "killer classes."

Now, this was an interesting event that happened to SparkFun in the
past.  The U.S. International Trade Commission intercepted one of
SparkFun's shipments of cheap Chinese multimeters and ruled them to be
infringing the trademark on Fluke's multimeters.  They ordered to
either send them back (for modifications) or destroy them.  The most
interesting thing about this is that Fluke was unaware that this was
happening until they learned of it from SparkFun's blog.  The way that
U.S. trademark and imports law works is such that the U.S. government
prepares its own guideline materials to check for infringement and the
filer is not completely aware of the legal interceptions and
activities that go on in relation to its filed trademarks and such.
Additionally, the description of the trademark was a bit ambiguous, so
minor misinterpretation can result in severe consequences.  Luckily
for SparkFun, it has a great community and was able to get some quick
recommendations to settle the problem as quickly as possible.  Fluke
decided to donate some of its multimeters in light of the
misunderstanding and the effect it had on SparkFun, while SparkFun was
also able to work with a law firm specializing in customs law to find
alterative locations to export the multimeters too rather than
destroying them.
