So, you're wondering, can aluminum foil be recycled?  Yes...  under
some conditions.

* The aluminum foil must be clean.

* The aluminum foil must be crumpled up into a larger ball, at least
  two inches in diameter, not left as a sheet.

* Your recycling service must state that they are capable of recycling
  aluminum foil.  If not, you'll have to mail it into a recycler that
  is capable.

* Note that plastic wrap cannot be recycled, unlike aluminum foil.
  Also, aluminum foil is easier to reuse at home.

* You can buy aluminum foil made from 100% recycled aluminum.  This is
  especially helpful when there is some aluminum foil that you cannot
  recycle.
