Good Reads, yes a venerable website.  Basically, it's a virtual
bookshelf that you can place all books you've read on, and most
importantly, make it available to the rest of the world to see,
publicly visible.  Now, books is just the start of what can be done by
this similar methodology, you could also do it with the movies you
watch, for example.  Yes, indeed Wikipedia does have a good deal to
say about the subject.  It assigns the broader category the name
_social cataloging_.

One thing that is particularly noteworthy reading into the subject is
that the main interest and merit as it is seen in the concept is that
of commercial exploitation: the design of machine learning recommender
systems that can answer the question "people who like this also like
this."  Yeah, on one hand it's good that people are motivated to
assemble such systems of social cataloging, but at the same time, it's
kind of sad to see that the main motivation of doing so stops promptly
after the point of sale of "consumable" media content.
