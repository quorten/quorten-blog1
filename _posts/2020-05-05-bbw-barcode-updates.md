Build-a-Bear workshop, I remember years ago they would put identifying
barcodes inside the plush toy bears customers would make together with
them that could be used to find lost bears.  But optical barcodes put
inside the stuffed bear, they require all the stuffing to be taken out
of the bear to find the barcode and read it, yuck.  Surely, they're
using a less invasive solution now where they put an RFID inside the
bear, right?  Wrong, they are still stuck on old-fashioned barcodes.

Nevertheless, one thing good they've been doing is partnering
specifically with Hotel companies to get Find-a-Bear rolling.  It's
pretty tough when you're the only game in town providing a service to
find lost objects that nobody else really cares about, so this really
speaks to trying to make the system more successful in the event of
lost plush toys.

This is interesting, Build-a-Bear workshop got a new CEO who started
making changes to the store to bring it back to profitability.  The
company before wasn't doing anything wrong, it just got to a point
that many companies get to when growing and being run by the founder
Maxine Clark: it grew past the abilities of the original founder.
Unwilling to make changes, the company was slipping away from its
previous position of strength.

The changes?  Focus more on tourism locations where tourists are
willing to buy more, pay more, and more in it for the experience,
close down unprofitable stores, focus more on media franchising which
brings lots of repeat business (gotta keep buying new toys every
single time a new movie is released, and gotta watch all the movies),
focus more effort to branding and marketing toys in styles that are
more appealing to boys like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Interestingly, the previous store as it was being run had a tendency
to attract lots of girl customers but not very many boy customers.
Yes, the novelty of the ideas of Build-a-Bear workshop was great for
getting the business started, but if left running that way it leaves
an obvious market gap untapped.
