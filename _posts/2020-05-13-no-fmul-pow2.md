Multiplying by a power of two in binary integers is easy: just shift
left.  Purportedly, it should be easy in floating point by just adding
to the exponent, so long as the number is not in denormalized form.
But, C doesn't have an operator to do this, why not?  The reason is
that most instruction set architectures don't have an efficient means
to do this directly on floating point registers, and round-tripping
between memory and floating point registers is expensive.

That's a real bummer that you have to pay this price in energy
consumption when computing with floating point.  But, we're pretty
much stuck with it, so long as we use general-purpose CPUs rather than
specialized DSPs or your own FPGA design.
