Interesting article here about the history of Northrop Field, an old
football statium on the University of Minnesota campus.  My particular
commentary, the article as-written could be better about its
geospatial resoning when presenting the modern photograph and tying it
in with the older evidence.  That's one important thing that the
article really just glossed over, but should be done much better.
Otherwise, I like the idea and approach, and the determination to save
information in the past and associate it with modern physical
structures.
