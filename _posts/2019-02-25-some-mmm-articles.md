Just looking around at the Mr. Money Mustache blog a little.  So, I
must say this point clearly.  There are surprisingly very little
articles published on this blog in a year.  I've found some
interesting articles, interestingly the Mr. Money Mustache knows Matt
Cutts.  Yes, the Google one.  Some other interesting highlights.
Recessions are actually a good thing if you are prepared, with the
right gear you can bike even in the very cold winter, renting an
apartment in Toronto, one of the most expensive cities, is actually
more economic than you think.

WARNING: Some articles contain vulgar language.  This is typical of
Mr. Money Mustache, unfortunately.
