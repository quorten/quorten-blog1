So, I was wondering about the status of EOMA 68 Earth Friendly
Computing Devices.  Unfortunately, there have been no updates on that
project.

On the other hand, the Libre RISC-V M-Class does have an interesting
update.  They're making progress fast on the design of the processor.
Implementing CDC 6600 enhanced scoreboarding the turned out to be
easier than expected, overall.  With all the progress being made, the
resulting design could just as well end up being competitive with
those of the giants of the industry.

That would be very interesting, but at best, I would assume it make
take a few generations of this processor design before that happens.
