I tried setting up a Rocket.Chat server and playing around with it.
These are the commands I used to set it up, and some notes about other
things I've found out about Rocket.Chat.

# Important note on problematic E-mail domain checking, and how to
# disable.  Note that you can set environment variables to change
# the settings, but only before the first time you run the server
# will they take effect.  Then, they will be read from the database
# on subsequent runs.
# 20160828/https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/2895

# IMPORTANT NOTE: One caveat with my configuration below is that I
# run the Rocket.chat server as root.  We probably want to run it
# under a lower user account so that some security breach can't
# cause a malignant process to read directly from the DB files etc.
# Or maybe this is a non-issue when inside an isolated VM/container.

# Note: This syntax is setup to only work with GNU Sed.
# Note: selinux is already disabled in images, so we don't
# need to do anything here.
# sed -i -e '/^selinux=/c\selinux=disabled' /etc/selinux/config
# I think we don't need to technically install nano here to get
# Rocket.chat working.
# yum -y install epel-release nano && yum -y update
yum -y install epel-release && yum -y update
reboot

# Continue after boot.

# WARNING: This will require an admin login as the site URL will
# end up changing, and Rocket.chat will prompt you to update
# this config setting.
```

----------

Create an admin user as your first user.  I just use
E-mail = nobody@example.com, username = admin, password = admin.

Proceed to Administration in the Web UI.

Now, adjust permissions.  Add to user:

* edit-room

* manage-integrations

It seems you may not be able to add custom Emoji in the current
version of Rocket.chat.

20160828/https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/1723

Another adjustment.  Create a #random channel and set
Default to True in Administration > Rooms.

----------

So please summarize, what are the bugs and missing features for
Rocket.chat?

* Threaded messages

* Clickable hashtag searching

* Cannot create custom Emojis.

* Cannot rename user account.

* Cannot delete/deactivate own user account.
