Terabit bus?  Is it possible?  Yes it is, but currently only via fiber
optic systems.  Well, anyways, my hope is that smaller electronics
will be able to scale up to bus speeds that fast.  Intuitively the
gigahertz clock speeds of modern semiconductors would limit the bus
speed of serial communications to gigabit speeds.  In any case, we
need a way around that limit that we have approached too soon already,
if we want to be able to keep increasing the speed and resolution
of our camera systems.

And don't worry, 16K resolution is coming here too.  Pundits are also
touting 16K resolution at 240 Hz being supported in newer GPUs.

For now, we'll be stuck in the "slow lane" with camera technology.
Well, most of us.  Only those willing to pay 10 times as much to get a
fast camera system today will have one that is 10 times as fast.  And
I mean, come on!  You only get 10 times more speed for 10 times the
price?  That can't seriously be worth it!  At least not from an
economic standpoint.  An exponential growth curve would assume 100
times the speed for 10 times the price.
