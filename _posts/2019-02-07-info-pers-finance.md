Some interesting articles on personal finance that I've found from
someone on Twitter, from links in the articles themselves, etc.

Increasing your income is an overlooked key to early
retirement... well, no, I disagree.  What we do agree on is that one
of the first problems with people is that they tend to spend too much
money and they increase their spendings when their earnings increase.
So, yes, if you have spending fixed and out of the way first, it does
make sense to look to increasing income as a second step.

But you know what?  I have my own opinion on the subject too.  Let's
remind ourselves of one of the reasons why we work.  One of the major
reasons why we work is because we want to know that we are doing
something that is appreciated by other people.  Now, yes, on the other
hand, if you want time for yourself where you are not influenced by
other people, yeah having savings for your own living without an
active source of income is good.  But, in this sense, early retirement
is not for everyone.
