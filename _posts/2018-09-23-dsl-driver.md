So, for quite some time I was wondering about what the correct
screwdriver to open the old DSL router/modem was, and I think I've
come to a logical conclusion: JIS screwdriver.  "It's like a Philips
screw head, but it is flatter, like you chop a little bit of the tip
of the screwdriver off."  Yep, indeed that is what people are
describing about the JIS screwdrivers and heads.  Matter of fact, some
people even recommend flattening the tip of a Philips screwdriver to
get a JIS screwdriver, although that still won't quite be a full JIS
screwdriver.

Runner-up: Poszidriv screwdrivers and heads.  Upon closer examination,
this can't be it because it doesn't have 45 degree angle smaller ribs.
Yes, the tip is flatter as is needed, but a driver with 45 degree
angle ribs on it won't fit the screws if they don't have likewise
indentations.
