Recently I was reviewing television video standards, so I just had to
visit the Wikipedia articles on the subject and read about the fools
who sit on the other side of the television.  This is what I found,
again.  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

How much time Americans spend watching television... surely people who
watch a lot of television have trouble getting a boyfriend or
girlfriend, regardless of whether they watch dating or romance things
on the television, wouldn't they?  Well, that's an inconclusive
conclusion to draw.

Elsewhere on the Internet, I found some other interesting information
about the fools who.  On one hand, by finding an article about "how to
get a girlfriend" with mention of "television" in it, it just had to
have a few vibes of American culture sprinkled into its advice.

Another article, reasons why you, a girl, can't keep a boyfriend.
Now, this is quite a hilarious read because I can think of many former
middle school classmates I knew who got and lost their boyfriend over
the reasons mentioned in this article.  It's just too true.  Oh, what
interesting misconceptions the fictional world of fairy tales, romance
novels, and movies can give people.  But, this article, it is true to
the real world.

And this article, oh it's interesting how some people may be concerned
about media entertainment likes and dislikes in their romantic
relationships, but they shouldn't worry about that.
