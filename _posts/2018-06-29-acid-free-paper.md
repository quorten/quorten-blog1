Acid-free paper.  Suppose you want to recycle some random paper for
archival purposes, but don't know if it is acid-free paper or not.
How do you check for acid contents in paper?  There are "acid pens"
that you can use to draw across the paper and check if it is acidic or
not.  However, this is not viable for checking if there is ligin in
the paper that will degrade and make it become acidic over time.

Also, beware if you do buy "acid-free paper," as it may actually be
acidic.

Testing ligin contents requires more complex chemicals, but among
the different ways, one is fairly easy: Aniline sulfate.
