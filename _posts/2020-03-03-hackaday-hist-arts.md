When searching for an unrelated subject, I found these interesting
Hackaday articles about the history of CRT video camera tubes and the
history of parking meters.  Interesting to see the Hackaday
perspective on covering these subjects as opposed to the Wikipedia
perspective.  I must agree, the Hackaday site provides a useful forum
for discussing a concise narrative that would be barred from
Wikipedia.
