Is there an extension for Google Chrome to reformat paragraphs?

Nevertheless, I found something else interesting.  You know editable
HTML containers in browsers?  The implementation is actually quite
horrible.  You simply can't have a WYSIWYG HTML editor.

Well, well... I should qualify things.  You can't copy-paste generic
hand-written HTML into an HTML editor.  Of course historically HTML
was meant only to be generated by software, almost only software built
into the operating system, so you get the point here.
