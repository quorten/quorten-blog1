Coworking?  Basically, that is the creation of shared remote worker
workspaces, where people employed by multiple different companies will
be working in the same building, mainly for high speed Internet access
and a little bit of social interaction for lunch, etc.  I found out
about this from an interesting company one of the acquaintances of my
previous coworkers is working at.  This is their website and a few
notable blog articles that they've written.

The most notable thing that I am interested in is the bigger uptake of
3D scanning technology by coworking companies.  Yes, this is good news
when you are not sure of where the technology will find good
applications.
