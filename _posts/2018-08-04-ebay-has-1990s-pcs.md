I've carried this assumption for a long time.  You can't find 1990s
era computers on Ebay.  They're simply not as iconic as 1980s
computers.  Now, is that really correct?  Let's validate that
assumption.

Start by searching for a brand name of a 1990s era computer that's
documented on Ebay, TriGem.  Indeed, my assumption was flawed.  The
verdict?  1990s era computer parts can easily be bought and assembled
in piecemeal from Ebay listings.  Finding a full 1990s era PC, on the
other hand, is more difficult.  There are several listings for TriGem
floppy disk drives and hard disk drives, a few for motherboards, and
I've only seen one for a full PC system with case.

But, the point in hand.  My assumption was flawed.  Indeed, it is
possible for an ambitious collector to have the original historic
system assembled and get a living system going.

I've also found this other interesting vintage computer web site.  It
has some useful information for collectors, and it has a listing and
sales site of its own.

And another interesting site here, `motherboards.org`.  Apparently
this site has some good information on old computer motherboards and
new ones alike.
