What parts of our modern computing experience have solidified early on
and haven't changed much ever since?

* Mass market Human Interface Devices (HID):

    * Raster scan, square pixel, video display(s).  A bit-mapped
      framebuffer is used by the video card to drive the display, not
      a software-controlled dynamic serial video signal.

    * Audio output

    * Keyboard, mouse, tablet input

    * Touchscreen

* Telecommunications analogy for remote computer access

* Command-line protocol for system administration, programming,
  debugging, and other highly technical computer uses

* Text editors

* Text-based programming languages

* Computer games, especially those that only use mass-market input and
  output devices

* **Small** graphical user interface controls.

* Logon screens, screen lock

* Computer terminal access methodology

* Telephony and video conferencing/calls

* E-mail

* Audio/video playback software

* Web page access

Our modern computing world has some constructs that, though not
universal, have become very popular for specific popular device
classes.

* Smartphones and tablets

    * Integrated video camera, i.e. "video input"

    * Integrated microphone, i.e. "audio input"

* Laptops and desktops

    * "Windows" that separate out applications, documents, web pages,
      etc. in the graphical user interface on the larger screen area.

    * "Rich text" editors.  What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG),
      especially noteworthy given the more advanced text editing
      available, compared to smartphones and tablets.

    * "Office productivity suite": word processor, spreadsheet
      software, slide presentation software

* Game consoles

    * "Game pads," i.e. video game joystick controllers
