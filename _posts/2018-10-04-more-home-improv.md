Home improvements, mainly around new addition.

* Shock-mounted garage door opener

* Drainage system for the garage

* Conduit for telecommunications cable, for easy upgrades.

* Chrome-plated supports to hold bathroom mirror in place, to avoid
  corrosion.

* Possibly change the position of the bathroom fan to be more directly
  over the shower.  Shower mist condensing on the mirror surface can
  cause harm to it.

More home improvements:

* Temperature and humidity monitoring and sensors for every single
  room.  Ceiling fans for all bedrooms that are plugged into control
  system.  Hard user controls to choose between auto control and
  manual control.  Whole house monitoring is used to determine central
  control, rather than that of just a single sensor.

  More than just a thermostat, a humidistat to keep humidity
  controlled.  Not too high, not too low.  Importantly, the meters are
  visible to users, rather than just assuming "defaults" are okay.
  The hard limits are set by default, of course, just as is the case
  for a thermostat.

  Yes, effectively a zone heating system.

  Now, this is something interesting to consider?  Do you need zone
  heating for wide open spaces?  The short answer is no.  Why?  What
  is it that hinders air flow?  Walls.  If you don't have walls, there
  is not as much hindrance to air flow, so not as many machines are
  required to direct it.  On the other hand, the disadvantage with
  wide open spaces is that you are going to need bigger fans to
  effectively direct the air, or lots of smaller fans.  You want to
  avoid spinning small fans faster due to the increased turbulence and
  noise that will create.
