Looking at an example X11 software, I see mention of "drepper."
Ulrich Drepper?  Wow, he's been around working in a lot of software.
What other things can I find on the Internet about Ulrich Drepper?  A
lot.  Beyond the criticisms of some hostile comments working with
others on glibc, Ulrich Drepper has produced a lot of other writings
and useful publications.

Also, Ulrich Drepper had quite a number of things to say about Richard
Stallman and given insight into why the Linux community does not like
the "or any later version" part that you can add for specifying the
terms of the GNU General Public license on your software.
