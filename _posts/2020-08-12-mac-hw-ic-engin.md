The Bob Bailey Unit, or BBU for short, an important address and I/O
signals logic chip for the Macintosh SE.  Really, what more
information is there behind the namesake of Bob Bailey?  Here is a
great site for such information, from one of the very folks who worked
closely with Bob Bailey in the Apple Integrated Circuits group.  Very
interesting, how Apple developed their whole integrated circuits
design group in the Macintosh department.

Yep, the RTC chip was wholly engineered inside of Apple, and a
considerable challenge at that.  Actually, come to think of it, in
many ways it was one of the first of its kind to bring a
battery-backed RTC to the PC market.
