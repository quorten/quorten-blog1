This is a great Digi-Key article on considerations for long-term IoT
sensors.

And... one thing in particular it covers in depth is the use of
lithium thionyl chloride batteries.  Oh, those monsters again, what
could possibly be good about them?  Despite their prospective risk for
explosiveness at the end of their lives, they have among the lowest
self-discharge rates of all battery chemistries.  So, if you have a
low-current application that you want running for several decades,
lithium thionyl chloride batteries are the way to go.  If you don't
mind the possibility of explosion and corrosive damage to your
electronic device, that is.
