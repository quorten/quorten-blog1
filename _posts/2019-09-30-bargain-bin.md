Bargain bin... ah yes, a common terminology, but what does Wikipedia
have to say about it?  Why is it a "bin" rather than something more
organized?

Well, well, that I do not quite know about, other than the fact that
it is common to just put it in a bin.  I guess what makes it so is the
store owner's sense of urgency simply to get rid of the stock as
quickly as possible, under the false guise that eschewing the little
effort required to organize is a significant time saver.  Which, as
those of us who know better, isn't.  Well, that's all I can say.  It's
a common human trend to do things that way, regardless of the logic of
doing so.

But, what is really interesting: "inferior good."  This is a good
which those of higher income buy less of, rather than buying more of
as would be predicted by their aptitude to spend more money.  As a
consequence, inferior goods come to be associated with the lower
class, while the opposite, _superior goods_, are associated with the
upper class.

Even more interesting, the Giffen good.  Even as the price of an
inferior good goes up, people of the lower class will purchase more of
it.

"Variety store" is also related to "bargain bin" by the Wikipedia "See
also" links.  "Dollar store" is another name.

And a similar phenomenon of the bargain bin in computer world of the
1990s?  "Shovelware," so called in relation to the phenomenon of
CD-ROM vendors packing as much software onto CD-ROMs as possible,
regardless of quality, to fill up their sheer capacity.  Though, also
in the music and recording industry world of the 1990s, similar
complaints were made about CD-ROM albums: they would have one good
song, and a whole bunch of other junk songs to fill up the space.
With the advent of individual downloading from online stores, the
annoyance of shovelware has all but vanished.

But really, I have to say.  What's with all the complaining about
shovelware and bundling?  I see it as a perfectly fine and more honest
view of the world, when in this world, people want to bias their
experiences to only the most entertaining.  By all means, "shovelware"
is more useful to historians as it provides a more objective and
unbiased view of the full world, rather than only providing an
objective and unbiased view of the part of the world that people view
as most entertaining or memorable.

But, that's just the thing that I called out.  The point is, it's all
about consumerism, and that's why the complaints surface as so common.
