Sure, I've previously noted information on how to crimp Molex
connectors, but now I'm looking for a really nice guide.  And I think
I've found one.  Not only that, but it also contains some interesting
information on pinball machines.  So that's why the pinball machine I
saw at one location disappeared a few years later?  Yes, indeed it did
break down, and the owner didn't want to repair it, so they got rid of
it and replaced it with an electronic arcade machine.

One thing to note about Molex connectors.  They have a limited cycle
life of around 25 insertion cycles.  Why?  Primarily, it is the
plating that gets damaged from insertions, not the gripping force.
Once the plating gets damaged, corrosion can advance and render the
connection unusable.  This is why gold plated connectors have a longer
insertion cycle life up to 100 cycles, because the plating is more
durable to the forces and stresses imparted on it.  Namely, it can
bend and flex better without breaking.
