Important!  So, now I've got _a lot more_ documents that I want to
scan, thanks to many of my improved technological procedures for doing
so.  But, what's becoming evident is that the staple removal process
is now one of the major bottlenecks.  So, how to streamline this?
Well, I've got to look for not just a regular staple remover, but a
_high-end_ staple remover.  A gentle staple remover, a quality staple
remover.  Surely by the year 2018, there are better products on the
market than the traditional staple removers.  So, let's get searching,
then.

So there is a kind of "push" staple remover.  This can be used for
documents stapled together, but maybe it works best for removing
staples from bulletin boards.  I personally don't prefer it to the
claw-style staple remover.  Not to say that I think the claw-style
style staple remover is ideal either.

However, apparently there's a variation of this design that has a
unique, higher quality staple release design.  But beware, reading the
product reviews on this, apparently this is even worse than the
push-style removers, which still aren't as good as the claw-style
removers.

A review from a secretary of a busy administrative office.  Good
staple removers are hard to come by.  Some of the best staple removers
are no longer on the market.  Partially quoted:

Looks promising, but lots of reviews unfortunately say it doesn't work
well.

Now, this is it.  Pretty close to the design that I want, and the
mechanism isn't too much different than my tried-and-true, gentle
staple removal process.

So, the solution is obvious.  I need a staple remover that is of a
quite unconventional design.  It might we wise to deisgn and simulate
my own design as a buying guide for products on the market.  The main
problem in designing and using my own wholeheartedly is the need for
metal parts.  A plastic staple remover won't last very long.

Wikipedia has some good videos on staple removal using the claw-style
removers.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Also, it is worth
noting that this is an area, lots of photos, 3D CAD designs, and
how-to videos are paramount.  I'll have to assemble this information
later, for the sake of excellent instructional materials for other
people.  For now, I'm just getting started, keeping track of notes for
my own reckoning on the subject.
