Wow, this is an interesting Wells Fargo story about how a home loan
processing person was able to help a family in need.  They were going
through tough times, their son had leukemia and his mom quit her job
to be able to help more with taking care of her, and they saw they
would not be able to keep paying for their home loan mortgage in their
current situation.  With help from the Wells Fargo side, they were
able to work out a temporary change to the home loan terms for an
exception to not make the mortgage payments for a year, in exchange
for extending the length of the mortgage term by one year.
