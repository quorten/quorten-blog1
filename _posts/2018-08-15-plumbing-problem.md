Plumbing is a consistent quality problem in homes.  Why is this?  What
is the specific quality problem involved?  Suffice it to say, every
home's plumbing is different, and any plumbers who come to work on the
plumbing in a home must be willing to learn the specifics of a
particular home and understand how that particular home works.  And
this is where the quality problem comes in.  Quite often, plumbers
aren't interested in learning the specifics in great detail, so that
is how the quality problems emerge.  Walls are cut through randomly,
pipes replaced haphazardly, hot water valve limits not calibrated
correctly.  And it's not just water plumbing, it also extends to
telecommunications, and in some cases electrical.

Alas, in either case, it is often times the homeowner who is most
responsible for having the greatest understanding of the specifics of
their local system.  And this is where many homeowners can falter.
