Is it possible to improve a sinking garage foundation without
rebuilding the entire garage?  Yes, it is possible.  Still, the answer
is the same as it was before.  Typical house garage foundations are
considered small structures, so "jacking" (sand jacking, mud-jacking,
slab-jacking) is the preferred method for treatment.  The alternative
that you were thinking of, piering, is typically only used on larger
commercial buildings, schools, etc.  There is also a list of things to
look for that are major foundation warning signs, such as diagonal
cracks.

Important!  Another note on garage and basement floors.  Do you want a
heated garage?  If so, you should design your garage floor to be an
insulated concrete slab, otherwise without a thermal break separating
the ground from the soil, that will just be a place to suck heat out
to the frigid exterior.

This is another interesting article about someone building their own
garage.  Especially useful is the mention of their thermal treatment
of the floor.
