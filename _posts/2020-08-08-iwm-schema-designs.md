Important!  Looking for information on how the IWM/SWIM works?
Looking for some legible scans of Apple-style schematics so that you
can copy stationary template patterns to an illegible scan that you
are reconstructing?  Look here, there's lots of great information at
this area on the Internet Archive, looks like it was submitted
directly by Apple themselves.
