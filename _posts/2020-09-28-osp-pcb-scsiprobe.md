Good note here, you see OSP (organic solderability preservatives)
finish options in PCB manufacture?  Keep in mind, that finish only
protects from corrosion for a few weeks, so you must promptly assemble
after receiving finished boards.  But, it is the premier choice for
cheap mass market boards like PC motherboards and game controllers.
In any case, that's one of the reasons why ENIG is better for hobbyist
projects.

Also, another note, you know that cool Macintosh SCSI identification
utility that you've seen screenshots of on textfiles.com?  Well,
this tool may be it: SCSIProbe.
