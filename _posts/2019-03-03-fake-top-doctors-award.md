Have you ever wondered about all those "Best Doctors" and "Top
Doctors" things out there?  Surely, they can't be all that
representative of the full medical field, now can they?  Indeed, they
are not.  There is this really interesting story of a journalist, who
primarily investigates the medical field and literature, who received
a "Top Doctors" award.  He accepted it after some deliberation,
deciding that the humor and the investigative lead was worth it.
Indeed, there are many such questionable or fake private awarding
agencies out there, and as it turns out, often times the reason
they're so successful is that they are able to take advantage of
doctors.  Many doctors are so busy and having assistants handle things
like this for them that they can easily be taken advantage of.
