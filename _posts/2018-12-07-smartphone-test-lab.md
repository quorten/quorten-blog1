Automatic smartphone test lab?

Oh, so this is interesting.  Here, I'm seeing results for what an
automatic smartphone test lab looks like for the sake of hardware
manufacturers.  I was first thinking mainly about some of the
automatic test labs set up for software developers like Facebook.

So, some of the interesting things they have setup:

* Camera tests inside of realistic 3D environments

* Anechoeic chamber acoustic tests, holding the smartphone at a
  variety of weird angles.

* Sitting test, with authentic jean patterning on the apparatus.

* Full water submersion tests.

* Testing inside a variety of climates

* Drop tests, spin tests

* Testing for RF interference using elaborate setups in an "RF
  anechoeic chamber."
