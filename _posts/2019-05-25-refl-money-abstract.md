One thing about finance nowadays is that we have a lot of tools and
technologies for finance, but one fact that sometimes tends to be lost
in the complexity of the modern world is that everything is still
based off of olf fashioned bartering and trade.  So, let's take a look
one personal financial technology stack t hat is fairly common
nowadays.

1. At the very base of economics is _bartering_, _bargaining_, and
   _trade_: the idea that you can exchange two different, incompatible
   goods and services _as if_ they were of the same value.

2. As an abstraction of the direct trade of goods and services, goods
   and services can be exchanged for a quantity of a single type of
   objects, and these abstract objects can then be exchanged again in
   other trade transactions.  This facilitates a large range of
   trading options with the new abstract intermediate quantity.

   The most pure form of "a single type of objects" is a single, pure
   element, of which the easiest to obtain is a non-reactive pure
   metal such as silver or gold.  The exact quantity of this element
   can then be easily and empirically determined by means of its
   weight.

3. As an abstraction of the weight of a pure elemental metal, metal
   coins can be symbolically assigned arbitrary monetary values
   regardless of their physical weight.

4. As an abstraction of coins, "bank notes" or paper money can be
   assigned an arbitrary monetary value.

   However, forgery is a high risk issue with paper money, as paper
   contents that are conventionally visible to unaided human eyes can
   be printed with ease.  Security printing is used as a
   countermeasure to counterfeit paper money, but it is only effective
   where the security markings are verified, which may only happen
   long after the original counterfeit transaction, negatively
   effecting an unrelated third party user of the counterfeit
   currency.

   There have been some efforts to create the electronic equivalent of
   paper money, but forgery has generally been a more extreme problem
   for the electronic equivalent.  One of the notable efforts, is
   Bitcoin, termed as _cryptocurrency_.  It uses a cryptographic proof
   of ledger to counteract forgery, making it more similar to a
   centralized bank, but still attempts to be closer to the properties
   of distributed anonymity that physical money is famous for.

5. As an abstraction of paper money, cheques can be written as
   instructions to a bank to apply a money transfer of a specific
   quantity between two bank accounts, rather than having the account
   holders exchange the equivalent amount of paper money.

   For convenience, the "pay from" entry of a cheque can be filled out
   in advance, and bundled into a "cheque book."  This makes it easy
   for a single person to pull out a cheque from their cheque book and
   fill out the rest of the fields to satisfy any needed payment.

   Alternatively, instead of writing and filing cheques on paper, it
   is also possible to do electronic cheque transactions.  The old
   notable version of this method was "wire transfers" of money
   between banks by the means of telegraph and telephone lines.  The
   modern method used by most banking customers is electronic cheques
   that are filed on the Internet.

6. As an abstraction of a cheque book, a "credit card" or "debit card"
   assigns the "pay from" stationary element copied across several
   cheques in a cheque book to a single card.  Therefore, the card is
   smaller and easier to carry around than the case of a cheque book.
   This card identity can then be used by a cashier to fill out either
   a paper cheque or an electronic cheque to complete the banking
   transaction.

   Similar to cheques, there is also an electronic Internet banking
   equivalent for the use of credit cards: a credit card identity can
   be entered online, rather than on paper, to complete an online
   transaction.

   More advanced credit cards contain embedded electronics that allow
   the identity of the card to be ascertained more easily.  For
   example, RFID or near-field communication may allow a card to be
   identified by simply being in proximity of a cash register, rather
   than needing to remove it from a wallet so that it is optically
   visible to a human or can come in direct contact with a magnetic
   stripe reader.

   Modern smartphones can also satisfy a payment function similar to a
   credit card or debit card, but without the need to acquire the
   specific physical card as provided by the issuing financial
   intuition.  Rather, generic smartphone hardware can be used
   instead.

7. As an abstraction of a credit card, debit card, or smartphone,
   biometric identification can be used instead.  Once the biometric
   identification of a human has been asserted, it can be checked to
   see if it is tied down to an account in an appropriate financial
   institution.  If it is, the financial identity can be retrieved,
   which basically amounts to the virtual equivalent of a credit card
   or debit card that can then be used to complete the financial
   transaction.

   However, some forms of biometric identification are at high risk of
   forgery.  For example, if face recognition is used for biometric
   identification, and transactions can be completed on a smartphone,
   then it is very easy for a con artist to hold a photo of someone
   else's face in front of the smartphone camera and go undetected.

Finally, when the highest level abstraction technology is combined
with automated inventory checkout mechanisms in a store, or even in
someone's home, it is fully possible for someone to just walk into any
building they want, pick up whatever they need or want, walk out, and
the machines will automatically handle all the monetary transactions
for them.  If there are sufficiently able-bodied robots, and the
taking of an object is unauthorized, then the robots can automatically
police that person and prevent the theft automatically.

Sure, these automated systems handle the automated exchange of goods
and and well, but what about services?  For services, don't you still
need to make a manual request?

Not so, if the adequate technology is available.  An automated
computer system continuously surveys the Earth at the highest level.
It determines the locations where there are humans, but it needs more
data to make effective decisions regarding those humans.  It then
deploys worker robots to correspondingly install new sensors to gather
more detailed data, and the overall inferencing process on data detail
and collection continues.  The system builds detailed models of all
human behaviors to determine human needs and wants.  When the
environment that the humans live in change significantly for there to
be a threshold event to perform a service, the system automatically
issues a service request.  If there are sufficient robots and
automation to fulfill the request, then the request is fulfilled
completely automatically.  Otherwise, a service request is
automatically scheduled to a corresponding human who will manually
complete the request, and once the request has automatically been
determined to be complete, the human will automatically get paid.

Wow, you've got some very good points there, you must truly be a
philosopher of a sort.  It is true that increased technological
automation tends to further displace people's understanding of how
things actually work in the real world compared to how people _think_
things work from the standpoint of their own head, but there is a far
larger problem that essentially overrides that one: "humans are
creatures of habit."  Unfortunately, despite what we would _like_ to
think about more manual money management, they do **not**, in fact,
help people better understand money and personal finance, **except**
at the very beginning when the habits are set up for the first time.
Once the habits havbe been built, the human brain operates on
autopilot, until the end.

For a small minority of people, this happens naturally as part of
their daily habits.  But for most, they need a bit more of an external
push before they start to change their habits.  So, if you start by
making the statement that some people have bad habits that need to
change, and this change can be facilitated by learning XYZ, back up.
First you need to realize that you need a practical means to entice
someone to break the bad habit.  As it turns out, this is a function
of psychology that can be understood completely independently of
financial technology.

So, you ask, what is the future of financial technology?  Well, from
what it looks like, the future of financial technology will
increasingly focus on the differences between human psychology and
technical practical realities.  The technical practical realities will
be automated away as heavily as possible, but the human psychological
aspects will be approached more head-on.  The next most valuable
financial technology innovations, it appears, are not in abstracting
payment methods, but in trying to de-abstract physiological phenomena
and make those more concretely understood by the people who are
affected by them.

Or, at least that's my own blurb on the subject.  This last part of my
blog article could be overly speculative.
