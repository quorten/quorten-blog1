Lossy 3D model data compression and surface fractures.  Sure, model
splitting allows you a mesh more similar to the real topology, but for
a surface that has a lot of fractures, would that not compress as
well?  Indeed, the "messy" way does compress better, given that there
are less mesh points.  Then again, lossless compression might help to
alleviate this particular problem.
