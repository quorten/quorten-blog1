I remember reading about the Franka Emika robotic arm many years ago
as being advertised as a much cheaper and easier to use robotic arm
than the typical industrial robotic arm.  Well, we've come a long ways
since then.  Not only is there the Franka Emika out in the market, but
there are now many other competitors too, such as the AGILUS.  Alas,
the prices are still about the same... $29,351.27 and going up from
there.

Unless you go really cheap and use this Tinkerbit robot designed by
Arduino.
