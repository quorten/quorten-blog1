I've found these interesting copyright articles from the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF).  The first one, new legislation, The Music
Modernization Act, limits the term length of old music copyrights so
that many very old recorded music is now entering the public domain.
Yes, it has its flaws, but it is indeed a step in the right direction.
One particularly interesting point about it is its provisions for
orphan works to cede into the public domain.  This will serve as an
important test ground for legal precedent for solving the orphan works
problem in other areas of copyrighted works.

This second article, this is a really nice reflection on the economic
value of copyrighted works versus public domain works.  Many of our
most important information works, data, facts, laws, etc., have never
existed within the purview of copyright and have always been
considered by their creators to be in the public domain.  Only
recently are "third parties" to the original creators trying to claim
copyright on their products and disputing the claim that it cannot be
covered under copyright.  Arguably, the economic value of public
domain works has always been much greater than that of copyrighted
works, and copyrighted works should be viewed as an exception, not the
norm.
