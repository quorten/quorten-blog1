Well, Apple has been warning of this future for a long time, starting
a few years back, and now it's finally happened.  32-bit application
support has been removed from macOS Catalina.

With all the changes happening to macOS, it is certainly clear that
Apple is trying to make the desltop operating system a lot more like
their mobile operating systems.  That is, the money-making systems
that are selling in absolutely massive numbers.

Also note that it's been quite some time since Apple dropped support
for HFS filesystems from macOS.

Well, the compatibility was fun while it lasted, and it made vintage
computing a bit easier on "modern" hardware, but with all the rage
from tablets and smartphones, the average modern computer user really
doesn't care all that much about the historic computer hardware.
