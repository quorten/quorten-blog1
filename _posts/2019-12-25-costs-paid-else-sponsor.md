So, when working on many projects, often times I find it important to
account for costs paid for by someone else.  Why?  Because if a cost
required for a particular project is being paid for by someone else in
the present, there is a risk that funding source may no longer be
available in the future, and you'll have to find an alternate funding
source.  So, I'm trying to figure out how to measure that in my
accounting equations.  "Economic externalities" is another way of
stating a similar thing.  Surely, there's an official way of doing
this in the accounting practice, isn't there?

"Sponsorship" is the word that comes to my mind.  So, what does
Wikipedia ahve to say about this?  Well, it is almost entirely focused
on the idea of sponsorship as a means of brand promotion in return.

Well... when I think about this, yeah, indeed this is a common trend
even when it is not overt and explicit.  The jobs you work that build
your resume, are, in essence, a form of "sponsorship" by you.  You
sponsor work at a company in exchange for the ability to put your work
experience on your resume.

Also, this extends to corporate donations.  Because companies like to
publicize donations in a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
newsletter or the like, they are not, in fact, pure donations of their
own right, but it is in fact sponsorship.  Only when people truly want
to give without expeect for any reward or recognition can it be
recognized as a true donation and only that.
