Ah, yes, Tandy started out as a leather business, but then they moved
into computers with 8-bit computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Interestingly, I did not know that Tandy was making IBM PC clones in
their late history, and the computers used "Tandy" in the name rather
than "Radio Shack" because the customers reported that the name "Radio
Shack" was bad for the office.
