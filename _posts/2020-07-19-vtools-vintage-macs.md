Want to connect your vintage Macintosh to the modern Internet?  Take a
look at `vtools`, this is the intermediate proxy server you need to be
able to access essential services like E-mail in a vintage-friendly
manner.  Just drop in a vintage-styled Raspberry Pi "modem" to connect
to your modern Ethernet or Wi-Fi network and you're all set.
