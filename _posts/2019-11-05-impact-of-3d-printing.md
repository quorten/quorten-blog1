For many decades, standards in 3D models was troubled area, but with
the rise in popularity of 3D printing, it feels like de facto
standards are finally emerging.  Printers are strong forces in
standardizing data formats.

One notable artifact of injection-molded plastic parts is the
conspicuous inclusion of part numbers and technical markings.  Many 3D
printed designs are devoid of such details since they need not pass
through as many "middlemen."
