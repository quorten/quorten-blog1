How do you setup an RSS feed on your new Jekyll blog fast?  Here's
how.

1. Add the plugin to `_config.yml`.

       plugins:
         - jekyll-feed

2. Verify that `_site/feed.xml` is being generated.

3. Add a visible link on your blog to `_site/feed.xml` for the user to
   "subscribe" to your blog.

4. Edit `default.html` or `head.html` to add the `<link>` tag that
   points to your Atom/RSS feed so that browsers can show the special
   RSS feed button for your website.
