Back in the days of the late 1990s and early 2000s, I remembered
seeing many school bus side passenger windows that were made by the
company "Guardian," with the distinctive "G" logo on them.  "Those
windows aren't safety glass" I knew, as I thought we've talked this
through before...  car windows are safety glass, school bus front and
rear windows are safety glass, but school bus side windows are _not_
safety glass.  And by safety glass, I mean the glass-plastic-glass
sandwich.

Well, we can hold that thought about safety glass, even on car
windows.  So, I was looking at one of the old 1970s or so era large
glass back door windows in my house, and I noticed that it also had
the distinctive Guardian "G" logo on it.  So, I looked closer at the
markings and read "Guardian tempered safety glass."  Interesting, so I
looked that up on the Internet, and this is what I found out about
it...

Guardian tempered safety glass is 5 times stronger than annealed
glass, so it is less likely to break.  But, if it does break, it
shatters into very small pieces that are less likely to cause injury
than larger shards.  Now, about the side windows on cars.  For many
car models, those windows too are designed to shatter into many small
pieces, and only the front and rear car windows are truly made of the
glass-polycarbonate-glass sandwich.

Guardian is a pretty old company... and float glass is a surprisingly
young technology.  Not until the 1960/1970s did it gain commercial
scale.
