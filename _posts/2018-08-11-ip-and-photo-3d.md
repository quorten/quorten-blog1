How long do design patents last?  Their terms are limited to 14 or 15
years in the United States, generally.  Apparently there is one
exception for the American Legion, though.

But, the big point in hand is this.  What intellectual property issues
should you worry about if you are doing a big 3D scanning project?
Thanks to the limits of patents, we have a clear list of things that
you do _not_ need to worry about, especially if you are scanning
older, historic objects.

* Rule of thumb: if you know the age of the object exceeds the term
  limit of some intellectual property law in question, its use is
  unrestricted.

* Design patents: 14-15 year limit

* Utility patents: 20 year limit

* Trademark: Renewable indefinitely.  However, its use is permissible
  under fair use in "photographic" style uses, where the primary use
  is to convey the look of the object, not to sell it.

* Copyright: As of 2018, term limit unknown.  Legislation has been
  continually increasing the copyright term limits to a rare number of
  high-value items from ceding into the public domain.

  Due to the vagueness of copyright law, the correct way to interpret
  it is from opposite _de jure_ and _de facto_ viewpoints.

    * The _de jure_ viewpoint states that copyright term limits may be
      70, 90, or 120 years after the date of publication.

    * The _de facto_ standpoint states that copyright is not enforced
      on the vast majority of copyrighted items older than 28 years.
      Only a very rare number of well-known items older than 28 years
      that are clearly known to have active parties enforcing the
      copyright on them are covered.

      Also, the type of media in question has a strong influence on
      the longevity of the _de facto_ copyright.  Particularly, items
      that are very cheap to manufacture such as books, movies, music,
      and video games are most likely to have long-standing copyright
      enforcement.  More difficult to manufacture objects
      three-dimensional objects, especially those not inspired from an
      easy to manufacture media source, are least likely to have a
      long-term copyright enforcement.

      Furthermore, the _de facto_ standpoint states that for these
      most popular items, chances are that they may be copyrighted
      indefinitely, unless and until a court case proves that the
      original copyright was never valid to begin with.
