Through hole desoldering.  Got solder stuck in a stubborn hole and
having trouble getting it out?  One of the big sources of desoldering
frustration can be if a through hole is connected directly to a
heatsink or ground plane, because the heat will get conducted out to
the plane and the joint will not get hot enough to clear the solder
away.  One good trick is to use a hot air gun to help heat the joint
up a little hotter so you can remove the solder.  Another trick
is to put some bare solid copper Cat5 wire through the hole to clear
things up better.

Finally, a good point to note.  Solder wick can cause you trouble with
desoldering because it can soak up some of the heat and subtract from
the heat available to apply to the joint.
