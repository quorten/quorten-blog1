Wow, so the news of WeWork not doing well financially was looming
long, and now it finally happened, a sweeping layoff.  WeWork cut its
non-core businesses, WeLive and hte WeWork inspired private school,
and is focusing in its primary area, office real estate leasing.  Yes,
just as I anticipated, WeLive did end up to be a failure in the
marketplace, and I was surprised that they did pursue their idea of a
WeWork inspired school at all.  Cleaning and facilities maintenance
jobs were all kept by transferring them to an external real estate
services contracting company.

WeWork thought of a whole lot of great ideas, it's just that the
ongoing problem must hold, that it is very difficult to innovate in
real estate, especially "consumer" real estate, due to customer lack
of willingness for change.  But in the business world, where change is
inevitable, obviously people are forced to move at a faster pace.
