Okay, so I'm getting closer to building the project that replaces my
need to own the physical Apple IIc Plus computer, so I'm thinking
about putting it up for sale.  But I don't just want to ship it again
in the tattered old lamp box that it came in, why not create some good
sturdy box for shipping it in and maybe even having a retail look to
it?  Well, finding the Apple IIc Plus box was moot, so this really
came back to revisiting the old info on the Apple IIc unboxing I've
found, but apparently did not save, years back.

My guess of the original box dimensions is that they must be about
15.5 x 16 x 10 inches, something like that.  Well, yes, somewhat
similar to the original Macintosh boxing but slimmer.

Alas, searching for that failed search subject, I still did come
across some other interesting infornmation, someone else's experience
on Apple IIc Plus, got some useful information.  Particularly
interesting was the display evaluation, there are some specialist
security displays that work great for Apple IIc Plus 80-column font
mode?  Yes.

And there is this other interesting project worked by this blogger
called Veronica, an attempt to build their own GPU.  Then a link to
the root of their website.
