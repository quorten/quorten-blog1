So, now I'm looking for a used tripod with horizontal center column
capabilities from National Camera Exchange.  I've seen to have found
only one:

* Name: MANFROTTO 3001
* Name: BOGEN 3001
* Price: $39.99
* Location: Golden Valley
* Maximum height: 55 inches
* Weight capacity: 11 lbs. (5kg)
* Weight: 3.6 lbs. (1.63kg)
* Color: Aluminum finish

This is it!  A bit short, but it works for my intended use.

A second potential alternative, MANFROTTO 3021S SHORT, is too short at
a height of only 3 feet 15 inches.  My floor shooting requires more
height than that for proper visibility with my chosen 50mm lens.
However, this might also have horizontal center column abilities.

Unfortunately National Camera Exchange's current site state does not
provide very much information on used products, so I have to searh
around elsewhere on the Internet to get this information.

Ball heads.

These are the **modern** ball heads that I looked at and like.  Yep,
only two that I like out of those that are available used, maybe three
if only I could get more information on the last one.

Pros on first one: separate lock for panning.  Cons: most expensive
used one, even more expensive than some of the new ones.  Then again,
the cheaper new ones are not better.

* Location: Golden Valley
* Price: $119.99

These are "oldies but goodies," so I am either told or led to believe.
These are quite heavy, from 1.9 pounds to 5 pounds.

I _don't_ want this one.  Perhaps I should note.  Ball heads with
handles are likely to be more useful for videography than for still
photography, when you want to do smooth panning during video.  For
still photography, using a ball head without any handles is likely to
work just fine.  (After all, you've got your ergonomic hand grip on
your camera, right?)

Double check.  Verified: A Pentax K-1 L-plate uses an Arca-type (Arca
Swiss) mount, which is the same that my desired tripod uses.  Again,
beware of expensive L-plates and try to shop around for an L-plate
that is reasonably cheap.

Don't forget a tripod bag.  Okay, that tripod bag is quite expensive
at $94.39 at bhphotovideo.com.  Yeah, it's nice, but I'll wait and see
on this one.  First get a tripod and verify it works well for my
workflow.  Oh, but it's "__trashed".  Yes, there are cheaper tripod
bags available too, so take that into consideration.

Okay, so this site provided another useful introduction to tripods.
High-end tripods are modular with all of the following components:

* Legs
* Collar, to mount legs and center column together
* Center column
* Ball head

Note that detachable legs from a collar, of course, can easily sport
into a monopod.

This mentioned tripod, however, probably doesn't meet my needs.
Horizontal center column support?  I can't confirm this.

Gitzo is the name brand nowadays (well, at least in 2010) that
provides the gold standard of tripods, so we were told from that article.

Great information resource on old tripods that are no longer in
production.

Cool macro focusing rail kit.  (Alas, it says "__trashed" so it may
not actually be available.)

And finally we still have the links to the three other tripods that
were recommended from articles in my previous notes on better tripods.

----------

As it turns out, my first great link on camera tripods already went
over all of this criteria.  So, suffice it to say, this is nothing
new, I'm just reiterating to test my memory and so that I remember.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

What functional criteria is most important to consider when picking a
tripod?

* Maximum height
* Minimum height: how low to the ground can the tripod go?
* Weight capacity
* Weight of the tripod itself
* Length when folded up
* Can the center column be placed in 90 degree horizontal, so that the
  camera can photograph parallel to the ground without the tripod legs
  being in view?
* Is there a hook for mounting counter-weights?
* What is the leg lock type?  Is it flip-lock or screw lock?
* Can the legs be spread independently?
* What kind of ground are the legs designed for?

What functional criteria are most important to consider when picking a
ball head?

* Weight capacity
* Quick release plate capability
* Angular range
* Locking mechanism: Is there only a single locking mechanism, or can
  different angle adjustment axes be locked independently?
* Does the ball head have levers that stick out of it for making
  adjustments?  Levers that stick out can be a nuisance for
  transporting.
* Alternatively, does the ball head have a handle that makes panning
  for videography easy and smooth?

NOTE: With modern DSLR cameras that contain digital levels built-in,
levels on the tripod are no longer a necessity.  However, these were
definitely important in the earlier film era where SLR cameras would
not have such a function built-in.  So, that being said, that also
applies as good advice if you want to do modern shooting with a film
SLR camera.

Other considerations: Tripod ball head mount screws are generally 3/8
inch.  Camera mount screws are generally 1/4 inch.
