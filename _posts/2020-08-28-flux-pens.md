So, I bought a flux pen, and I was ready to use it in one of my first
projects with lead-free soldering.  But... the tip looked dry and it
didn't really look like it was dispensing any flux at all!  What
giveS?  Okay, okay, first thing I found out, when using a flux pen for
the first time, indeed you must wet the tip, you get sold a pen with a
dry tip.  When wetting the tip, make sure you hold the pen upright,
tip facing up, otherwise the flux wants to leak all out.

Another good point, flux pens are easy to refill.  Just pull off the
tip of the pen, and dump your new liquid flux in there.
Alternatively, flux pens are easy to empty should you wish to dispense
your liquid flux by other means.

Okay, okay, so I'm still not sure on how to wet the tip.  Just warm
water or alcohol?  Okay, here is a hint.  Shaking the pen up and down
is useful for getting the tip wet.  That makes sense since you just
pour the liquid flux in after taking off the tip.

So really, I guess there's a combination of all possible methods you
can use that would be the best.

If it's water-soluble, you can use water-based methods.  Otherwise,
you should use alcohol.

UPDATE: So, the results of my own experience?  Just shake it up and
down looks to be the trick to get the tip wetted before first use, no
need to use water or alcohol of the sort.  Plus, you can keep the cap
on when you're shaking.  How do you know if it worked?  Beyond the tip
not looking so dry, you should be able to smell a little bit of vapors
after you've shaken, then you can know pretty well it is working as it
should.

That being said, another point in hand when using the flux pen.  If
you have been using the flux pen to cover a lot of joints, you might
need to shake it around to get more liquid flux into the tip if you're
having trouble with the pen not dispensing enough flux.
