Okay, to get ourselves started on 3D printing.  Let's just look for
some interesting designs that other people have made that I need and
see if I can 3D print them.  Wow, this is really great.  It almost
makes me feel like the future of purchasing manufactured objects is in
3D printing.

Indeed, this part does reveal that making current generation 3D
printers still don't produce parts as strong as injection moulding.
The fact that the poker geometry had to be altered for structural
integrity and the part has to be printed from a certain orientation.
Oh, and the knowledge required to be good at making 3D printed
designs.

Okay, but I should not limit myself to Thingiverse.  What other online
3D design repositories are there out there that provide a similar
function?  Well, Wikipedia is the place to go to find out about these.

Oh, interesting what this 3D selfie article has to say.  The
techniques revolve around optical recording, but each uses different
software in the computer to perform the reconstruction.  The printing
techniques, by contrast, are largely the same.  Of course, you
wouldn't want to have a probe poke someone all over their body to make
a 3D scan of them.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  3MF is the competitor
to AMF.

Well, it's inconclusive.  For-profit 3D printed design sales targeting
the consumer market have not become profitable.  The incumbent stance
is that this is ground only well-inhabited by industrial customers and
hobbyists, but no one in between is a candidate for conclusion.  That
being said, Thingiverse is one of the best known among hobbyists.
