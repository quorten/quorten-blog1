Can you 3D print silicone?  Indeed, you can.  So you can build your
own computer keyboard entirely via 3D printing and circuit board
printing.

How about glass?  Indeed, that is 3D printable too.  It's possible,
though the tech may be rather expensive and beyond the reach of the
typical hobbyist due to the high temperatures involved.  What do you
expect for glass?  It's going to be a similar challenge as 3D printing
metal is.

Can you 3D print fiberglass?  Yes, looks like you can run it straight
through standard FDM plastic 3D printers.

Also interesting is that Onyx can be 3D printed, which is a form of
silica.

Inventory of 3D printable materials as of 2019:

* Plastic
* Metal
* Gypsum, i.e. plaster
* Paper mache, and "cotton mache" by extension
* Fiberglass
* Silica, i.e. onyx
* Ceramic
* Sand, concrete
* Glass
* Synthetic rubber
* Silicone

Nothing left to buy... okay, integrated circuits, electronics, it's
all too high tech.  Even woven thread materials like clothing are
still tough to 3D print.

BUT, do not forget, you can construct motors out of printed circuit
boards.  In theory you could also 3D print resistors of your desired
resistance value with ease, which would greatly help you slim down
your collection of resistors of various values.

But yeah, overall, my reaction?  WOW.  I am impressed by how far tbe
3D printing technology has come in the past few years.  Although it is
what you might call a "sleeper" innovation in terms of the consumer
mass market, this is definitely tremendously useful and valuable
innovation for the specialized niche market that wants it, namely
designers, small run custom manufacturers, and high-tech hobbyists,
specifically those involved in electronics.  It's all about 3D
printing finding its niche, and in the meantime, it has found its
niche very well.

What material is bone made out of?  Chemically, it's somewhat similar
to gypsum plaster and drywall, calcium phosphate and other minerals,
but bones are complex composite structures and fully living organs.
So you can't just "3D print" a replacement bone and call it a bone in
its own right, you'd need the living parts too.
