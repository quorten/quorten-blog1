This is an interesting viewpoint on not being able to abstract
privacy.  What does that mean?  The author starts with some background
on a very old technique practiced by a Detroit police force before the
advent of modern computing: STRESS (Stop The Robberies, Enjoy Safe
Strees).  The idea was to embed disguised police officers as ordinary
laypeople throughout the area, so that potential criminals would
always be on the lookout and self-police.  However, as the author
points out, living through such a regime, the effect of this was far
from this ideal.  Rather, it caused criminals to be more evasive and
look further into more private life, and for those who were not
criminal, but could be suspected as such due to demographics, they
felt they were always being watched and treated as suspects.  Zero
privacy in the world for them, unlike their counterparts of different
demographics.

Now, enter the modern era.  We live in a world where the idea of
surveiling someone in the public does not require asking for their
permission.  We have slumped this far down in privacy over the
decades, irrespective of the technological means to the end.  And in
today's world, we have an even more curious construct.  There are
those who are paying to be surveiled by their "Apple Watches, IoT
toilets, quantified baby products, [Smart] Ring Doorbells, [and]
Teslas," whereas others are "paying the price for being watched," "in
the form of ankle bracelets, license plate readers, drones, facial
recognition, and cell-site simulators."
