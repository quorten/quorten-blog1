Interesting articles I've found here referenced from discussion on
Twitter.  Does depression have a heritable advantage?  Interestingly,
some of the genes that cause depression also seem to have an effect on
strengthening the effectiveness of the immune system.  In the old
days, any cuts or wounds would almost certainly result in infection,
and without modern medicine, that would very likely result in death.
But, the alterations in the immune system caused by the same genes
that caused depression strengthened the body's ability to fight off
infections, if not also causing changes in the brain that would
completely avoid situations that would likely result in infection.

In modern times, however, infection is not at all an issue to treat
with modern medicine, so the tables are turned.
