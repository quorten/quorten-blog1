When reading the Linux kernel system logs on an old computer, I saw a
notice that computer's particular CPU had the L1TF bug.  What is this?
It is another CPU hardware bug similar to Meltdown that allows reading
privileged data via a side channel timing attack, due to the specifics
of the L1 cache behavior.
