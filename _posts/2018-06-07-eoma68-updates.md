Updates on EOMA68?  Unfortunately there haven't been any in quite some
time.  Yes, now it's just waiting for manufacture, and the project
lead is working on other things for money.  However, there are a few
interesting past articles.

So, the point that I wanted to mention here.  EOMA68 is designed to
have RGB/TTL video support.  Yes, that is one of the primary
requirements.  HDMI is an additional nice-to-have.  So, even if the
HDMI connector testing doesn't pan out, the boards will still be
functional.
