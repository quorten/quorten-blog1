Raspberry Pi board uses M2.5 screws.  Though you could size up to M3
with some drilling.

Board thickness is 1.4 mm.

Raspberry Pi standoffs should be at least 11 mm board-to-board
distance.  Here are some parts that match those dimensions.

Here are some almost ideal parts on Digi-Key... slotted instead of
Philips screws, but one millimeter short for Digi-Key standoffs.  Use
a paper/cardboard spacer I say.
