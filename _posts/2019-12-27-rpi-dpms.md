BAD!!!  DPMS is not properly implemented on Raspberry Pi!  No worries,
that is a quick fix, albeit a hacky one.  At least it is possible.

As for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, well they are going to have to
stop complaining about not having the software development resources
to be able to implement DPMS proper, because they need to make way for
the influx of full-time Raspberry Pi desktop computer users coming
their way.

So, the solution!  A partial solution for testing if `vcgencmd
display_power` does what you want is this script.  Note that `vcgencmd
display_power` is similar to `tvservice -o` and `tvservice -p`, but
better.

```
#! /bin/sh

# Timeout in milliseconds.
TIMEOUT=60000
MODE=on

while true; do
  IDLE=`xprintidle`
  if [ $IDLE -gt $TIMEOUT -a "$MODE" = "on" ]; then
    vcgencmd display_power 0
    MODE=off
  fi
  if [ $IDLE -lt $TIMEOUT -a "$MODE" = "off" ]; then
    vcgencmd display_power 1
    MODE=on
  fi
  sleep 2
done
```

If this is **not** powering off and on your display properly after the
designated timeout in milliseconds, then you need to search for some
different power control commands to use.  Otherwise, you can move on
to implementing this as a `systemd` service.  To do this, you need to
be able to determine which user is owning the display at a particular
time so that you can route the power control commands accordingly.

```
#! /bin/sh

export DISPLAY=:0

# Timeout in milliseconds.
TIMEOUT=720000
MODE=on

while true; do
  XUSER=`ps -eaf | grep LXDE | head -n1 | awk '{ print $1; }'`
  IDLE=`sudo -u $XUSER xprintidle`
  if [ $IDLE -gt $TIMEOUT -a "$MODE" = "on" ]; then
    sudo -u $XUSER vcgencmd display_power 0
    MODE=off
  fi
  if [ $IDLE -lt $TIMEOUT -a "$MODE" = "off" ]; then
    sudo -u $XUSER vcgencmd display_power 1
    MODE=on
  fi
  sleep 2
done
```

Name it `/usr/local/bin/goodscreen.sh`.  Now write a `systemd` unit
file, to start it like you would from `/etc/rc.local`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Run goodscreen screen saver.
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/goodscreen.sh
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Name it `/etc/systemd/system/goodscreen.service`.

Now you're in business for more serious desktop computing use!
