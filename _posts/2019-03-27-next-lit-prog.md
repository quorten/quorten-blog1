Literate programming.  Ah, yes, the venerable creation of Donald
Knuth, a great idea in concept, just that it failed to become popular
in the greater software profession.  So, what does Wikipedia have to
say about literate programming in this respect?

Oh, now this is very interesting.  So, although Wikipedia is not so
punctual in stating this, literate programming does have a clear
successor that lives on today.  First of all, let us remind ourselves
that Donald Knuth came from a largely academic background.  If you
look toward programming in the academic and research fields, you will
find that the modern-day concept of electronic lab notebooks is the
practical revitalization of literate programming.  Mathematica, Sage
notebook, Jupyter, you name it.  If it's a "notebook" interface that
allows you to intersperse text, graphics, code, and visualizations,
then you've got yourself the modern-day equivalent of literate
programming.

Another prime example of modern-day literate programming is found
outside of academia in the form of technical blogging.  If you're
writing a blog article in Markdown, and you intersperse coding
snippets throughout, with the expectation that you are creating a
how-to programming walkthrough article, you're also doing another
modern-day form of literate programming.  Matter of fact, there are
some software tools to make this process easier for the sake of also
automatically generating an executable program from the same source.
It's just that, well, you know, that technology hasn't become very
popular in practice.  But, if you wanted to declare modern-day
literate programming, that is where you would find it.

It's important to understand that reference documentation generation
from a single-source is _not_ considered literate programming.
