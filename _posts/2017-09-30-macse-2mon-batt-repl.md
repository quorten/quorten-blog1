Important!

This was that Macintosh SE article that I've found that has a second
monitor connected to the Macintosh.  This appears not to tell of the
battery specifications.

What should we use for the replacement battery on the Macintosh SE?
This.  "3.6V Lithium 1/2 AA PRAM Battery for Mac."  Actually, this is
pretty easy to buy from Batteries Plus+.  Just look for a lithium 1/2
AA.  Make sure you specifically ask for a lithium battery as you do
not want the battery to leak inside of your vintage computer
equipment.

Beware, however, that the early Macintosh SE just solders the battery
directly into the board.  The later models like SE/30 and SE FDHD use
a socket to make the battery easily removable.  The recommendation?

Don't worry if you can't replace the battery, though.  The early
Macintosh SE will still boot without one.

Well, if I am going to need to put a battery socket in, I might as
well also take the opportunity to locate the battery off the
mainboard, right?  What is the best way to build the battery
compartment so as to prevent leaks from damaging the vintage
electronics?

Failed search.

contain leaks

Okay, so now I'm going to have to make this call myself.  Plastic is a
tough material, it should be able to hold up well against leaked
battery chemicals.  That being said, the box that contains the battery
should be made out of some sort of plastic and mostly close up, but
the closure shouldn't be gas-tight, as batteries can release gas.
