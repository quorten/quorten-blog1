Wow, now we're seeing T-shirt designs about people surviving the great
Slack outage yesterday?

Now this is really interesting, this Snapchat and its outage.

But this is even more interesting, the article on ephemera.  Ephemera
are "not meant to be preserved," but they end up getting preserved
anyways, and that's what the whole article is about.

* Footnote: But, come on, seriously!  Why does something need to be
  _designed_ to be preserved?  Humans will always be foolish when it
  comes to making such decisions, so it is best that the whole process
  be totally automated and everything be preserved, regardless of
  intent.

** Plus, historians are most interested in the largest volumes of
   information.  Yes, that means the collective sum of all such
   information that was never meant to be preserved.
