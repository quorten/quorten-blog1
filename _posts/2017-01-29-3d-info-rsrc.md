Okay, so I was looking around at the Raspberry camera stuff, and I
found some interesting new things.  In particular, a lot of useful 3D
information resources.

* Particularly interesting on the article above was the number of
  times people talked about purchasing and payment requests to design
  a waterproof case for Raspberry Pi 3.  Wow, very interesting.

Oh, wow, GrabCAD, another online repository of CAD designs, in
addition to Thingiverse.  It hosts a lot of _open-source_ designs.
But is it also open-source itself?  Well, that I have yet to figure
out, but I suspect that it is not as open-source as I'd like it to be.

SketchUp 3D Warehouse?  Max model size of 50 MB?  It must not be that
good, then.

TurboSquid?  The largest 3D model marketplace at 370,000 models?
Heck, with 3D scanning, I'd expect a repository of _billions_ of
models, and with Internet of Things data aggregation, a repository of
_quintillions_, due to the trillions of devices participating in the
network.

So anyways, we know that relying on human artists produces 3D content
at an appallingly low level of productivity.  I shouldn't say human
artists, but this is an even more restrictive group of those who are
_techically skilled_ in 3D graphics software.
