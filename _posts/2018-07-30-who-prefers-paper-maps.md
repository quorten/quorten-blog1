So, the verdict?  Extreme adventurers will prefer to also take a paper
map and compass with them in addition to a GPS device.  Some may even
go without a GPS device, but most will not.  For sure, non-extreme
adventurers will prefer to use a GPS device over a paper map and
compass, and they may opt not to carry around a paper map.
