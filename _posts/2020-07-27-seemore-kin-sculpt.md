Another report of a Raspberry Pi supercomputer?  Come on, that has
ought to be another over-hyped report on the power of the VidCore IV
GPUs.  Well, this project's main purpose was to create a visual art
form that is also somewhat of a good demonstrative example of how a
supercomputer works.  It was originally designed on Raspberry Pi B's,
then later upgraded to B+'s.  So, yes, stuck on 100 Mbps Ethernet,
doesn't make for a very good communications bus for any sophisticated
uses.  It is "kinetic sculpture" because each Raspberry Pi node is
mounted on an articulating arm.  In all senses, not very practical,
but for sure, designed for entertainment.

Currently the computer is disassembled and stored in boxes.  Alas, its
primary design goal, that of being put up on display, ended as a
long-term failure.  Besides, if you take a look at the described
audience, you can tell they're pretty much all already geeks anyways.
