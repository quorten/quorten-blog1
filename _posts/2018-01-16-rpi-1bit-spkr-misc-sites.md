Just to verify.  Yes, indeed it is okay to wire up a pizoelectric
speaker directly to the 3.3 V GPIO pins, PWM for best results.  Use a
small one, though, if you don't want it to be too loud.

Wait, CodePlex is being shut down???  Yes, GitHub is the cited
successor.  How well is GitHub actually doing in their financials?
They seem to be doing somewhat well.

Interesting.  In case you are wondering about this "Medium" website,
social journalism, the response to declining revenues in traditional
journalism.
