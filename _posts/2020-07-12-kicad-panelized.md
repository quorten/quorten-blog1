Creating panelized circuit board designs in KiCad?  How do you do
that?  It's necessary if you want to take advantage of certain offers
provided by printed circuit board manufacturing houses.  Well, there
is no straightforward way, but a plugin for KiCad helps automate some
of the work, though duplicating the board will have to be done
separately.

There is also this other nice utility that operates directly on Gerber
files, useful if you need to merge together the output from different
CAD software programs.
