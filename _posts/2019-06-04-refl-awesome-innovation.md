In the blogosphere, I've been in the middle of some epic blog writing.
And I say this, and I know what you're going to be thinking in
response... too much information, right?  But this is the thing: it's
about 1980s and 1990s computer innovations, and you lived through it,
but boy, A LOT happened during that period of time, and it's
conceivably pretty difficult to explain it all to a modern 2019
youngster.

Inevitably, we have to admit that many of the innovations that did
happen are still present today, but they are of a complexity that many
people probably will never fully understand.  Most importantly, most
people don't care to learn and understand them anyways.

So much innovation simply happened so quickly, a new world was quickly
brought upon society before we could fully understand it.

But now, the time has passed where those who would have wanted to
fully understand it now do, and for those that don't, well, they are
simply content living their lives without a complete understanding.
And chances are, they never will.

In comparison, technological progress has been feeling pretty slow in
the modern era.  CPU improvements are unimpressive, hard disk drives
are reaching their density limits, there is virtually no hard
scientific innovation in modern computers, just miniaturization and
increasing density of the integrated circuit concept.  Tantalum
capacitors, solid-state drives, LCD displays, LED displays.  Yep, it's
all just integrated circuit fabrication.  No electromagnetism, no
optical laser engineering, no Helmholz field compensation, none of
that.  Gorilla Glass is the modern equivalent of the toughened glass
found on the front of CRT monitors, but its not truly innovative per
se.  Modern electric vehicles are just scaled up remote control toy
cars.  Okay, okay, so the "remote control" part is just an accidental
security vulnerability.
