How far away is Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our sun?  But
a mere 4 lightyears.

Here, there is a lot of interesting discussion about why our
Earth-ball we live on is so extremely unlikely to be found elsewhere
in the Universe.  Most of the Universe is either too barren or too
violent to be reasonably stable for complex life to flourish.

This is an interesting concept to reach Proxima Centauri.  Build a
light sail and propel it with Earth-stationed lasers.
