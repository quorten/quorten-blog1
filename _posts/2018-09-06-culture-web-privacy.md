Now, this is interesting.  So, we know that the United States is a
more individualistic culture that values privacy more than the rest of
the world.  But this is particularly interesting.  I found this survey
study about how people across the world value privacy in social
networking sites, andt there is some interesting data hidden not
directly related to the study.  Outside of the United States, there is
a strong correlation between social networking site use and technical
IT education or career.  Only in the United States (and probably also
Europe) is there a large population that uses social networking sites
that does _not_ have a technical IT education or career.
