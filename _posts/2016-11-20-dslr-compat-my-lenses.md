Okay, okay, time to learn what kind of DSLR camera I can use that is
compatible with my existing lenses.  Is the lens mount system
particular to Pentax cameras?  I thought advanced features are, but
the basic features are compatible.

By the way, it turns out that Pentax was a first to a lot of things.
Mattere of fact, Pentax was Japan's first SLR camera brand.

* Renote.  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  I searched
  for this and found it, that means it's important!  Pentax K-mount.

So yes, for advanced features, Pentax uses its own lens mount that is
incompatible with those used by Nikon and Canon.  In particular, my
lenses use the Pentax K_A mount.

Ah, and the article above just said that Pentax lenses are on the rise
in popularity due to rising popularity of the corresponding DSLR.
Likewise with Samsung.

Protrusions?  Where?  Oh, wait, yeah, they're there, just subtle.

So, what are the price points we are looking at for the Pentax K1?
$1800 to $2000.  That's a lot better price for the same quality, and I
get compatibility with my existing lenses, than was the case about 6
years earlier.
