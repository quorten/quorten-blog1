Sure, we know that ultraviolet light has its risks to humans, both for
skin and for eyes, but purportedly even strong blue light can be risky
too.  How?  It can more readily cause irreversible changes in the
retina that can lead to permanent damage.  The risks to humans in
domestic uses such as LED lighting currently seem relatively low, and
in general, this is much more of a risk factor when blue light is
abused or when people are otherwise overexposed in factory
environments, for example.
