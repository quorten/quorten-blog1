Yeah, yeah, we talk about first world countries a lot.  But you know
what?  The definition "first world" has been around for a long time,
people nowadays are living better than ever, and global poverty has
reached an all-time low.  Surely, the term "first world" is an
understatement of the living conditions some people experience every
day now.  What's better than the first world?  The "zeroth world," of
course.  Now, let's see. is there anything on the Internet about the
zeroth world?  There is nothing to be found from conventional sources,
but lo and behold, I look to blogs not unlike my own to find the
voices of people who know the zeroth world.

This is a tough search, and I have to turn to Google to get any useful
results.

So, what are some characteristics that people claim about the zeroth
world?  First of all, the social considerations of the zeroth world.
The zeroth world is a heavily middle class world.  There are no
household servants, people happily either do things on their own
around their home, or they employ robots to do those things.  Having
servants is considered "morally dubious and conceited."  In the zeroth
world, you do not refer to people of high education as "doctor" in
conversation.  Rather, you refer to them just like you would refer to
everyone else.  Dressing in luxury brands and jewelry is rare.

The zeroth world is a world where jobs are very heavy on the head,
knowledge worker jobs galore.  There is a lot of pressure such that
one may need to retire at age 50 due to the mental demands of the
jobs.  This also means that the gaps between being working and
unemployed are large.  Many people who are still right in the head but
don't make the high cut apply for government aid, and proudly so.
But, what this really means is that if you see any homeless people on
the street, you have to be really careful, because they probably truly
are insane.  So, be forewarned about helping the poor, unless it is
someone you really know such as a relative or old friend.

Norway and Luxembourg are touted as zeroth world countries by those
who reside there.

"As you see, it is not so much that everyone is like the rich people
in a poor country. It is a completely different culture and way of
life."

This article talks more about "zeroth world problems" for those who
have figured out the financial means to do well and be traveling a
lot.

But, in regard to the comments in the first article.  This does point
out a sad trend that has been sustained in the United States for quite
some time.  The great middle class that the United States once had is
fading away.  Income inequality is growing, and this article tactly
divides the U.S. into the Finance, Technology, and Engineering (FTE)
class, and the low-wage sector.  For the FTE class, 20% of the
population, the future is bright.  For the low-wage sector, 80% of the
population, the future is dim.
