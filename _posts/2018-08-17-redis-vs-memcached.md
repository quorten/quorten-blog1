So, now you're wondering.  This Redis, is sounds very similar to
Memcached, how do they compare?  Well, let's see.  Memcached is indeed
older than Redis, just as I suspected.  However, Redis has accumulated
many more features in a shorter amount of time, has a larger
community, more documentation, and is otherwise simply better for
newer projects than Memcached.  Memcached is still useful if you have
a project already using it, but otherwise it's not recommended for
much else.
