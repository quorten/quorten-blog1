One thing that is nice about electronics is that you can assemble
pretty compact kits to do a lot of electronics work.  Or, in other
words, this is a hobby that can be done without gear that is so bulky
as to be considered immovable and confined to a stationary building
that you must bring your team to.

Basic electronics project tools.

Note that tools are not to be confused with materials.  Materials
include any material that goes into the produced electronics project
or any tool that gets consumed during the project development.

Level 0: pencil, ball-point pen, pair of scissors

Level 1: precision screwdrivers (heads: flathead, Philips, JIS),
multimeter, anti-static wrist band, anti-static mat

Level 2: soldering iron (basic pencil type), safety glasses

Level 3: magnifying optics, armature

Level 4: electric oven (toaster oven size preferred, convection
preferred, custom temperature controller ideal)

NOT INCLUDED: Computer data adapters such as USB CMOS serial cable,
etc.  Those are considered part of a computer adapters kit.

Head-mounted magnifying optics preferred.  Looking around for a few
choices.
