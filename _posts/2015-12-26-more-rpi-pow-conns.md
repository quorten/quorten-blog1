Raspberry Pi, again.  Note, the defect in the Raspberry Pi 2 power
supply is particularly interesting.  Because the power supply chip has
no packaging, flashes of light can cause malfunctioning.

This page is particularly useful for determining the feasibility of
taking some digital data interface and transferring it across USB.

The Long Now Foundation?  Always use 5-digit years?  Really, it it
were up to me, I would not be padding out my years to any number of
digits if they were shorter or longer than the typical expected
length.

Proprietary hardware?  This is what you get for hiring an EE or ME.
No engineers at these low levels, no new incompatible and nonstandard
hardware.  That being said, the reason why older electronics tended to
feature much more nonstandard hardware configurations is because there
was a lot more engineering done at the lower levels for earlier
generation electronics.

VERY Helpful Raspberry Pi FAQ.  Yeah, I may have jumped too soon on
some of my adapters.  However, hopes are high for me, I've got reports
that they will work alright.  See my other [Raspberry Pi notes]({{
site.baseurl }}/blog/categories/raspberry-pi) for more information.

* From the FAQ, powering via batteries.  "Mobile phone emergency
  chargers."  Apparently this hints that these devices are capable of
  accepting AA batteries directly and then converting the current into
  a steady 5V power supply, which is perhaps the most convenient way
  to get a power supply for your Raspberry Pi.

Good information on HDMI.  Most interesting is Mobile High-definition
Link (MHL), a USB form-factor connector that carries HD video.  Yes,
but although MHL has good prevalence, the main problem is an awareness
problem.  People are simply unaware that MHL exists and how to use it.

Does the iPad have an HDMI video output?  No, but you can buy an
adapter for the iPad to get one.

Feasibility of a USB optical disc drive.  Overall, yes, a USB 2.0
optical disk drive is feasible.  However, it won't offer the fastest
possible data rates for Blu-Ray discs.

Let's not get the naming wrong.  DB-9 is a common misnomer when the
correct naming is DE-9.  That is, it is a connector with a D-shaped
shell of size E and 9 pins on the inside.  Nevertheless, DB-9 is a
common misnomer.

More information on Super I/O and supported peripherals.  All of these
peripherals detailed in the article are things that I potentially need
to buy an adapter for.

Seriously, I've got to figure out what that infrared port is on the
back of the ProGen computer.
