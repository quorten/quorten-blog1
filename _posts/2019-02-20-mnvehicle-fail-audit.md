This is an intersting audit on the failure of the Minnesota Vehicle
Registration system.  What were some of the primary causes of the
failure?  Interestingly, many of the problems that contributed to the
failure of the system were non-technical.  Poor management, poor
planning, poor documentation of existing business processes.  Poor
coding standards, poor regression testing, and lack of adequate user
acceptance testing were the main things relating to technical
failures.  Interesting, HP was contracted out early on to write the
system, but due to refusal to cooperate and their system failing to
perform to expectations, they were terminated and the system was to be
developed in-house.  As I have read elsewhere, around the time HP was
contracted to work on the system (late 2000s to early 2010s), they had
a reputation of terrible management at the executive level, causing
their business to loose half its value.
