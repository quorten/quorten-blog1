Wow, now this is interesting and a bit scary.  Beach restoration?
Well, taken on steroids, this is called land reclamation, and in the
United States, it is limited to doing precisely that: rebuilding land
that got lost in storms such as hurricanes, because it got ripped away
into the sea.  But, elsewhere in the world, people who practice the
tech means to this end are much more pragmatic.  They use the tech of
giant ships that suck in dirt and dump them elsewhere not just for the
process of rebuilding lost land, but also for creating entirely new
land and islands.

The scariest part about this is China's practice.  They have used it
to expand their claim of a chain of Pacific islands by building
entirely new land around their claimed ownership, then by building a
military base on it.  China is by far the biggest practitioner of
building entirely new land out in the sea, dumping and moving around
far more dirt than anyone else.
