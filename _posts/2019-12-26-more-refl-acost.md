The solution to amortized cost.  When the cost of doing many things
together is cheaper than the cost of doing each individually, how do
you describe that?  The trick is to not think about the individualized
cost, but the net cost.  Compute the full system net cost of the
collectively cheaper method, then compare that to the more
individualized method cost, and _multiply_ to compare that with the
cheaper system cost.

So then, the solution is simple if you want to do a blunt comparison
of the system cost with the individual cost.  You simply divide evenly
across all the actors in the system, since that is the conversion you
use for comparing with the more expensive individual cost.  Due to the
mathematical identities, this will give you the same totals when you
scale.  That is, assuming that you do not use a more efficient larger
system means of working, of course.

But yeah, really.  The point is to think bigger to bring about more
optimizations.  Your choices for optimizing a small system are
necessarily less than the case of optimizing a big system.

And this idea scales with code and software development too... when
you have larger code bases, the opportunities for optimization
increase.  Or, alternatively, the lack thereof optimization in a
larger code base can contribute to growing code bloat.

Sometimes it's not the operational methodology, but the accounting
method that is creating extra costs.  For example, if one person's
costs are much higher than another person's, but you are dividing
evenly.  In this case, simply using a more accurate calculation can
reduce your costs.

Another to thing consider, tool investment cost, how do you handle
this?  A simple way is to factor it into living expenses (or similar)
when determining the cost of a job.

So the point is, when setting billing points, you've got to think
about the future.  Or, think about past loans that are still in
payment and have certain payment goals.  Well, it's really the same
thing from a practical standpoint.

Yeah, the point is, though, when you throw tools into the equation,
everything gets much more complicated.  But it is the tools that
drives our modern accomplishments and labor-saving devices that
increase our productivity overall.
