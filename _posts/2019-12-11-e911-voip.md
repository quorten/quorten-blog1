Recently, I've got a new soft phone set up on my work computer.
Hooray!  Before this, I simply didn't a work phone number at my
particular job.

But, there were some interesting extra hoops I had to jump through.  I
had this E911 thing that needed to be configured and set up with a
name, phone number, and location, and it would require me to keep
updating it when the IP address changes so that the location
information is accurate.  What is this all about?  It is about making
sure that location and other metadata called "E911" is available when
a call to 911 is made.  Aw, come on, do I really need that?  Well, one
of the long-standing problems with VoIP was that it could not be
generally considered a full phone replacement solution as does not by
default provide all information for E911.  So some VoIP providers
explicitly disclaim having support for 911 calls to avoid hefty fines.

Now, if this is to replace an office desk phone when you are in work,
yeah I can see why they'd want to ahve suppprt for E911 too.  From a
practical policy standpoint, it makes things simpler to be able to
claim full 911 support without conditions.
