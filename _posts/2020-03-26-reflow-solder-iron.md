Solder paste, it sure is a nice material to work with, but is doing
reflow soldering in an oven the only way to work with it?  Can you
just reflow it using a soldering iron?  Indeed, you can!

Please note that if you are soldering through-hole components, using a
soldering iron with traditional wire-type solder still is the best way
to do that.
