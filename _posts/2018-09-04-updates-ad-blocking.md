Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Ad blocking?  Yeah I
already looked at this before, but what does Wikipedia have to say
about this now?

Oh, now this is interesting.

Reference source article is this one.

But now, this is a really interesting quote from that article.

So, yes.  Moral of the story, for the time being, use ad blockers.
