I only take nature telephoto-style photos every once and a while with
my DSL camera.  However, since I am deliberately going light on my
camera gear to maximize the economy of it relative to the quality of
the typical photos I take, this necessarily means that I end up using
my 50 mm prime lens and crop down photos to get the effect of
photographing wildlife with a telephoto lens.

So, now comes down the question.  Were I to go and buy a better lens,
what should I go with?

The 500 mm lenses appear to be unweildly, though they would be nice,
of course.  The Pentax 200 mm lens is pretty nice, light, and compact,
the quality is good, but the maximum aperture is f/4.  There is also a
nice 135 mm Pentax lens with f/2.5 aperture.  This one is apparently
pretty good for portrait photography, and some would recommend it
rather than the 200 mm for basic wildlife photography too.  300 mm?
Well, looks like it is not really worth it in terms of value.

Which is preferred, long focal length lenses or telephoto lenses?
According to the source referenced by Wikipedia, there really isn't
much difference between the two, the telephoto lenses are simply
shorter.  Check your lens quality charts and see if you can find
something you like.

A teleconverter is a lens accessory that you use to magify the image,
at the expense of photographic quality and optical resolution.

For wildlife photography, a "blind" refers to a cover that you place
over yourself to conceal yourself from wildlife.
