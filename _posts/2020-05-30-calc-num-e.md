Number e... a very important number that most of us have memorized to
about 10 digits, i.e. 2.71828182846, but how do you compute it?  Let's
review the definition of number e as it is typically presented, in the
problem of compound interest.

Non-compound interest is defined as follows:

```
A = P * r * t
```

"Annual equals principal times rate times time."  This tells us how
much interest money is generated over the given time period.  If we
want to know the total money, we rephrase the equation as follows,
using `I` instead of `r`.

```
P_t = P_0 * (1 + I * t)
```

Non-compound quarterly interest that is assigned a yearly interest
rate is defined as follows.

```
P_t = P_0 * (1 + I/4 * (4*t))
```

<!-- more -->

This can be trivially seen to be the same as the annual interest
equation.

Interest _compounded_ annually is defined primarily as a recurrence
relation.

```
P_(t+1) = P_t * (1 + I)
```

By some simple analysis, you see that you can rewrite as an equation
this by raising `(1 + I)` to the power of `t`.

```
P_t = P_0 * (1 + I)^t
```

Now, what if we want to compound quarterly rather than annually?
Simply put, if `t` is equal to one year, we want to effectively have
compounded 4 times rather than just one, so we put a factor of 4 in
the exponent.  But since we want the overall yearly interest to be
about the same, we also divide `I` by 4.

```
P_t = P_0 * (1 + I/4)^(4*t)
```

We can compound at smaller time intervals by defining a variable `n`
for the compounding frequency.

```
P_t = P_0 * (1 + I/n)^(n*t)
```

Now, what happens if we simplify this to the case where `I = 100%`,
`P_0 = 1`, and `t = 1`?  We get the following simplified equation.

```
P_1 = (1 + 1/n)^n
```

If we evaluate this with different values of `n`, we can see that it
converges to constant as `n` approaches infinity.  That constant is
number e.

```
lim_{n -> oo} (1 + 1/n)^n = e
```

However, if we evaluate this directly with a calculator using a
conventional number of floating point bits of precision, what kinds of
values do we get in practice?

```
n = 10, e = 2.594
n = 100, e = 2.705
n = 1000000, e = 2.7182805
n = 1000000000, e = 2.71828170574
n = 1000000000000, e = 1.0
n = 100000000000, e = 2.71828129627
```

These results are rather abysmal since `1/n` gets so tiny as `n` grows
large, and then we have to try to raise what looks like a roundoff
error to a very high power.  Surely, there's a better way to compute
number e, isn't there?  Indeed, there is.  Wikipedia gives an
unexplained magic solution that is much more numerically stable to
evaluate and converges rapidly.

```
e = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ...
= sum_{n = 0}^{oo} 1/n!
```

But how and why does that work?  Here, I present the explanation that
is the missing link between these two equations.

The trick to reformulating the equation is the _binomial theorem_.
The binomial theorem presents an easy way to expand any binomial
raised to the nth power into a polynomial series of terms.

```
P(n, 2) = n*(n - 1)
P(n, 3) = n*(n - 1)*(n - 2)
P(n, r) = n!/(n - r)!
C(n, r) = P(n, r)/r! = n!/((n - r)! * r!)

(a + b)^n = C(n, 0) * a^n + C(n, 1) * a^(n - 1)*b +
  C(n, 2) * a^(n - 2)*b^2 + C(n, 3) * a^(n - 3)*b^3 + ... +
  C(n, n) * a^(n - n)*b^n
= sum_{x = 0}^n C(n, x) * a^(n - x)*b^x
```

For small binomial coefficients, they can also be easily computed
using Pascal's triangle.

```
         1
        1 1
       1 2 1
      1 3 3 1
     1 4 6 4 1
   1 5 10 10 5 1
  1 6 15 20 15 6 1
 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1
1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1
```

Fortunately, the number e equation is a binomial raised to the nth
power, so we can use the binomial theorem expansion to rephrase the
equation.  Let's do that.

```
n = 5 expansion:

a^5 + 5*a^4*b + 10*a^3*b^2 + 10*a^2*b^3 + 5*a*b^4 + b^5
= 1^5 + 5*1^4*(1/n) + 10*1^3*(1/n)^2 + 10*1^2*(1/n)^3 + 5*1*(1/n)^4 +
  (1/n)^5
= 1 + 5/n + 10/n^2 + 10/n^3 + 5/n^4 + 1/n^5
= 1 + 5/5 + 10/5^2 + 10/5^3 + 5/5^4 + 1/5^5
= 1 + 1 + 2/5 + 2/5^2 + 1/5^3 + 1/5^5

= 1 + 1 + 0.4 + 0.08

Factorial series:

1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3!
= 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.167

n = 8 expansion:

1 + 8/8 + 28/8^2 + 56/8^3
= 1 + 1 + 0.438 + 0.109
```

What do we see?  Looks like we're seeing pretty much the start of the
factorial series in the first few terms.  What about the last few
terms?  Think about it, if `n` approaches infinity, you will be
raising `1/n` to a very high power, so the term will be
insignificantly small and not really factor into the final result.
So, let's see what we can find out if we take the limit as `n`
approaches infinity on the first few terms.  Fortunately, since the
first term in the binomial is one, that pretty much drops out of the
simplified term equation.

```
C(n, x) * (1/n)^x

x = 2
n*(n - 1) / (2! * n^2)
lim_{n -> oo} n*(n - 1) / (2! * n^2) = 1/2!

x = 3
n*(n - 1)*(n - 2) / (3! * n^3)
lim_{n -> oo} n*(n - 1)*(n - 2) / (3! * n^3) = 1/3!
```

Okay, the pattern should be clear now.  Computing permutations at the
limit?  When you try to add or subtract a constant from infinity, it
is negligibly small compared to your very large number, so it can
basically be dropped out and ignored.  Then you can just substitute
`n` anywhere you see `n - c`.  Happy, because of the structure of our
binomial, we are also dividing by `n` raised to an equivalent power as
the factors of the permutation, so those factors cancel out, leaving
us with just the `1/x!` factor from our combinatorial computation.
Now that we know each term can be simplified to `1/x!` when `n`
approaches infinity, we can rewrite our limit-transformed binomial
theorem expansion:

```
e = sum_{x = 0}^{oo} 1/x!
```

And that's how we derive the factorial series that Wikipedia just
magically presented without fully explaining.  (Except, in hindsight,
for giving a vague hint.)

With that knowledge in hand, we can not only happily compute `e` to
whatever number of bits of precision we may need, but we also have an
excellent numerically stable computational tool for computing any
binomial raised to a power.  When a binomial has rational terms, we
can rephrase it using the binomial theorem to get a more efficient
computational form.
