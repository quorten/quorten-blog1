Wow, it's finally coming here, for real!  The GitHub Archiving
program, an initiative to save **all** public code repositories on
GitHub to the Arctic World Archive (AWA) on microfilm.  Yes, this is
it, a testament to those who truly value what matters has the will to
preserve it long-term, using the best-of-trade tools.  Yep, this is
real, this is also a really good point for emphasizing the value of
software with non-technical family and friends.

Which repositories are included?  Any repository that has been
recently updated in the past couple of months.

There is also a lesser valuable initiative, in my experience, to
archive data onto a Quartz disc using a laser.  Come on, we know that
is pretty esoteric compared to microfilm, how is a naive human who has
little interest in the sophistication of the technology, let alone
little monetary resources of their own, expected to read and
comprehend anything out of such a form?
