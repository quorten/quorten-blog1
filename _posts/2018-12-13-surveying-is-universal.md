Okay, so I was thinking about "house logs for dummies," and one thing
became generally evident.  For virtually every project that you do,
the step one is identical: survey.  Building a new home?  Survey the
land before laying the foundaton.  Moving into a prebuilt home?
Survey the prebuilt structure that is lacking the blueprints.  Trying
to get data on a home in operation?  Survey the home so you can
determine how you need to instrument the sensor network.  Detecting
inaccurate data caused by missing data in your sensor results?  Grow a
bigger sensor network, but of course sensor network growth must be
guided by... yep, you guessed it, survey data.

Whether the project be to build something out or to measure something
in operation, the universal first step is to survey.  Unfortunately, I
don't think I can say there is a universal second step.  If you want
to run things in a rich data-driven manner, the second step would be
to build out a sensor network.  But, if you want to do things
bare-bones, you could just as well forgoe surveying and data
collection until you need to perform a major undertaking.  Yes, this
does mean that if anything goes even slightly wrong, you risk forgoing
the ability to catch the problem early, rendering what might be a
small fix into a major repair.
