Does Raspberry Pi have a watchdog timer?  I don't see any mention of
it in the BCM2835 technical documentation... but searching online,
indeed I do see that there is a watchdog timer module available.

First, enable it.

```
sudo modprobe bcm2835_wdt
echo "bcm2835_wdt" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

Now, you can use your favorite watchdog daemon software like
`watchdogd` to control it, or roll your own.

On Raspberry Pi 4, the watchdog timer kernel module is loaded by
default, you just need to run some software to enable it and ping it
to get it all set up.

So, all that said, Raspberry Pi is "airworthy" to be used as a
critical part of a home network, where stalls cannot be tolerated and
a watchdog timer is a must.
