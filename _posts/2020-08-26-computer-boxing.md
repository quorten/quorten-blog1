The name of the game?  Reproduce the Macintosh SE original boxing from
photographs and measurements.  So, let's start out out, the data:

Now, the research.  First of all, the Wikipedia article on the subject
of corrugated cardboard boxes.

Now, let's look for sources on how to custom manufacture boxes and
styrofoam blocks.  Here's a good one that is locally close to me for
cardboard boxes, start here with one of their stock boxes, then you
can move to a custom box job.

<!-- more -->

Expanded polystryrene (EPS) packaging is the name of the game, it's
what you want to recreate.  Univfoam looks like a pretty good company
to do business with for making custom such packaging, CNC routing to
cut away large blocks is the tech they use for the custom foam block
creation.  Come with STL 3D models and you should be good to go.

Sure, if you want authenticity, this is the material to use.  But be
forewarned that the recyclability of this material is not very sound,
its production accounts for greenhouse gas emissions, and it is
somewhat flammable.

So, my assertion of the technical information you need to know for box
manufacturing of the Macintosh SE box?

Regular slotted contianer.

19.5inx15.5inx20in

Liberty Packaging's standard box size 20 x 20 x 14 (model # 99) comes
pretty close.
