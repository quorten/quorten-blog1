So, more websites to find old terminals at other than that
old-computers.com website?  Well, let's take a look.  I found at least
one that might contain what I am looking for.  The point that at least
one if those old terminals was really big, really heavy, and required
a large, sturdy desk, but I don't know which one it was.

Oh, these might be it.  No, I think close, but not quite.
