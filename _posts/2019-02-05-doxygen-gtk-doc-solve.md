Important!  So, I'm still searching for a solution to import
Doxygen-style documentation into `gtk-doc` help systems like Devhelp.
And I think I've found a good solution: use GDOC.  So, that being
said, I can move straight aways to using Doxygen in full force for my
small-time projects without needing to worry for lack of documentation
conversion tools.
