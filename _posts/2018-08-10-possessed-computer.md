Random notes.

Computer possessed by demons?  Well, can we find more information on
the Internet about that, about getting a Wiccan witch to take care of
that?  Not really.  It seems this is not a widely held belief among
Wiccan witches that computers can be possessed by demons.  Matter of
fact, there are many Wiccan witches that do not even believe that
human possession by demons is possible.

So, the idea of doing an exorcism on a computer?  It's inconclusive.
