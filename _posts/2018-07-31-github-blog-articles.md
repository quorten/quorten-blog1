Now, there are a lot more interesting GitHub blog entries as of
recent.

GitHub has been a strong contributor toward improving Git LFS.
Namely, Git LFS import and Git LFS export makes fixing up Git LFS
errors and transitioning out of Git LFS a breeze.

Lots of modern open-source NES games are listed here.

Yet another 6502 programming guide, this time written by a more
modern author.  Also, importantly it mentions that as of 2018,
there actually is at least one modern manufacturer of 6502
CPUs (Western Design Center, selling to hobbyists).

Very interesting, GitHub implemented a security vulnerability scanner
for project source code dependencies for language-level package
managers such as Ruby, JavaScript, and Python.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  GitHub's terms of
service are libre, open source, also noted as a plus by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF).

Very interesting use of sentiment analysis.  A moderator bot monitors
for toxic comments, and responds with a link to the code of conduct.
Sure, the conduct of the bot itself could use improvement, but it's a
good start.  The other side of affairs: automatically congratulating
first contributors for their contributions.  Admittably pathetic that
the humans can't do it (for large projects), but a good start.

Google, however, is saying that their API is **not** ready for
automated moderation use, but should only be used as a human aid as it
is still very new, introduced in 2017.

Wikipedia and the New York Times are some of the early adopters and
deployers of this technology.  Wikipedia?  Meh, I don't think it will
help much.  New York Times?  That is going to work very well.

Wow, mention of Nvidia Tensor cores?  Indeed, they are here!  However,
they only provide a 3X average performance improvement over their
previous technology in the same series.  But that's a start.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Mention of ScummVM on
GitHub blogs.  (So you know it's still relevant.)

One developer's experience in porting an old Star Trek game to
ScummVM.

mitmproxy 4.0!!!  Actually used to uncover and fix some security
vulnerabilities.

Interesting GitHub blog post about laser cutting the contributor
graph.  Nothing special, other than the fact that the GitHub intern
who wrote it knew nothing about laser cutting before doing this but
passed by a laser cutting lab on their university campus every day.
