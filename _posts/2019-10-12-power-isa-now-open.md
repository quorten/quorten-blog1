Interesting, for a long time, the POWER instruction set architecture
information required for designing a CPU to it was held secretive
behind an expensive proprietary liccense, but now it is published
openly.  There is at least one Open Hardware reference design on
GitHub, take a look.

TODO!

Ah, so it turns out the clock does have a diode that allows it to get
power from the main logic board.  So when your Macintosh is powered
on, the battery is not being drained.

Interestingly, older Macintoshes had an externally reachable battery
compartment, to make replacement easier.
