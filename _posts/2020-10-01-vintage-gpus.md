Vintage graphics card upgrades, GPUs, a precarious area of discussion.
Most graphics cards ever manufactured are PCIe, but if you want a GPU
that plugs into an older computer, late 1990s or earlier 2000s, you
have to use one of the two older standards: AGP or PCI.  Some low-end
2000s computers omit the AGP slot, so that means that PCI is the only
universal standard for old GPUs.  However, when AGP is available, it
provides for higher performance.

So, what are your options for best performing PCI GPUs?  NVIDIA
GeForce 6200 512 MB is the most powerful, but it is also power hungry
at 300 Watts.  Second most powerful is NVIDIA GeForce 5700 LE,
probably consumes less power, but I've found it extremely hard to
find, the AGP version is much more plentiful.  Plus, it's the version
I currently have on hand (128 MB) but cannot use precisely because I
do not have an AGP slot available in the Dell Dimension 2300 low-end
PC.  Failing the availability of that card, you can downgrade to the
5500 and find a plentiful supply of the PCI version on EBay.
