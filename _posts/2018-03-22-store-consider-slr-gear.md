Important!  Thinking of getting more SLR camera gear, but where do you
store it?

This is a general principle.  When you work on putting objects
together in larger scales, you're working on architectural design.
Yes, in the small scale component assembly is engineering tooling, but
on the large scale it is architectural design.  Ultimately the large
scale has to follow some common architectural principles to be
accessible to humans.  That is, unless you are designing a larger
system that is 100% robot automated.  However, chances are that for
larger systems, it will be all too tempting to send humans into the
system to investigate failures, so it might as well be designed to
accommodate humans to some extent, even though the standard operation
may center around optimizing for machines.

And the smaller design scale?  Like I've covered earlier, the
preferred working method for this is a computer interface working
method.

What about the larger scale?  There's Urban Design, but historically
there was no such design at that scale: cities would simply evolve
"chaotically."  The larger scale?  The main design at the next scale
up regards Interstate freeways.  Yeah, mainly transportation networks
meant to connect big cities that are spaced geographically far apart.
Beyond that there is state, country, and province border design.
Beyond that are the coastlines between land and the oceans, which are
shaped mainly by nature and not by humans.  That's it.  Humans are
mainly terrestrial creatures that live on the Earth's surface where
there is breathable oxygen.  Despite the large surface area of the
oceans, those ellude humans who can't live within them.  Likewise, the
large volume of the Earth's mantle not only eludes humans, but most
larger animal life forms too.  Finally there's the whole Earth and the
Solar system, which is still much beyond human control, although still
within the scope of human comprehension.  This is the "new" mother
nature that humans cannot shape, only observe.
