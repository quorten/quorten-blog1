Now, this is some interesting insight.  15 years ago, "a large
retailer" (Walmart-Sam's Club) "shook up the supply chain industry" by
announcing that all suppliers must provide RFIDs on their shipments.
The early days, interestingly, largely turned out to be a failure due
to the difficulty of the RFIDs communicating with the readers and the
lack of features and functions of the software that processed the
data.  But now, RFIDs have advanced quite a bit and are quite a bit
more durable for this application use, not to mention that the gear
for reading the RFIDs is much better.  One of the problems with the
early RFIDs was that they weren't sticking to the packages well
enough!
