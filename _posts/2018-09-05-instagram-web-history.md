Instagram is owned by Facebook, right?  Yes, indeed it is.

Instagram was a separate company that was acquired by Facebook.
Interestingly, Facebook previously had the bad business practice
associated with Microsoft of taking too much control after the
acquisition and ruining the product.

> The WhatsApp acquisition closed at a steep $19 billion; more than
> $40 per user of the platform.

That means WhatsApp has 475 million users.  In other words, as of
2018, there was one Raspberry Pi sold for every 24 WhatsApp users.

So how many users are on Facebook?  It has more than 2.2 billion
monthly active users as of January 2018.  In other words, there are
over 110 monthly active Facebook users for every Raspberry Pi sold, as
of 2018.

Wow, this is it.  These are the websites on the planet, period.  You
can't get any bigger than this in terms of users.  All other ideas
that are not related to social networking can only garner smaller
communities of human users.  Yeah, you can build the biggest
machine-to-machine communication network that you want, and sure that
can serve some very useful purposes, but it's still just not the same
if there aren't many people using that system, if the only people
using that system are professional scientists and engineers.  Matter
of fact, that's literally what the early Internet was all about: a
network of machine-to-machine communications where scientists and
engineers were the primary beneficiaries, users, and maintainers of
the system.  Although the Internet user population has changed greatly
since those early days, the technical maintenance side has not: by far
the most significant change was "commercialization" of the Internet,
but other than that the technical and political operational
characteristics are much the same.

Wow, I just realized that perhaps not many Instagram users are fully
aware of what company owns in.  In Microsoft marketing of times past,
that would have been considered a bad thing.
