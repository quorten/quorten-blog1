So, I'm still wondering.  What existing open-source land surveying
software is there out there?  Surely, if I find such software, it will
have all the tools for surveying techniques already programming in,
making them easy to use.

So, wow!  This one was quite the find.  13 Libre GIS Software Options:
Map the World in Open Source.  Quite impressive, not only the feature
set of the software listed, but also the range of choices available.
Surely, one of those powerhouses will have the tools that you need.
And indeed, GRASS GIS is listed in there too!

But, there's the flip-side that.  Like you said, all of the options
are powerful and complicated tools, perhaps too complicated for the
needs of setting up a known structure in which to perform 3D scanning
inside of.

There's this other land survey software that was originally written in
DOS, then ported to C++.  Not particularly interesting, unless you are
looking for a decidedly simple solution.

* Footnote: Alas, I would prefer to name it libre software, but I was
  concerned those search terms may not bring up very good results.
  Yeah, that's the way things are when we live in a world that is
  determined by search terms and buzzwords.  It makes or breaks the
  difference on whether you can find things.  And, ultimately, it's
  recognizably the #1 thing that makes the Internet difficult to use
  without prior knowledge.  You can't really explore around on today's
  Internet and expect to reasonably learn how it works and use it
  well.
