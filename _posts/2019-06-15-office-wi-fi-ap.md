Office Wi-Fi access points?  What kind of wireless access points are
typically used in offices?  Well, I haven't been through very many
offices, but the few that I have been through, they all looked rather
similar in design, so surely they must be from the same manufacturer.
Indeed, I spied on one such access point, and it clearly said "Cisco."
Also, from what I know about these offices, they buy all their office
equipment from CDW wholesaler or the like.

So, with that information in mind and some basic web searching, this
is what I found.

Bought from CDW wholesaler, Cisco Aironet 1142
Controller-based-wireless access point is a popular model.  Check
Cisco's site for tech specs.  Pretty conventional hardware, but sold
at a high price.  A little higher-end, though.
