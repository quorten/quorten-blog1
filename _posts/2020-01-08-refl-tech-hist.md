For many years over the course of the late 2000s, it felt like
Microsoft was really doing nothing to advance their technology.
Procrastination?  No, it really felt like brinksmanship.  This kept
going for a few years until they were pounded by the "iron fist" of
the rest of the tech industry, a.k.a. "invisible hand."

Bill Gates pulled out, when he still could have kept going with
keeping Microsoft as a business doing well.  Some folks might tout,
Microsoft was never really necessary in the end, now were they?  Well,
we can tell them that they wouldn't have their fancy nancy computers
that they have today without such leadership.  But is that really
true?

At the end of the day, I have to conclude that it's not.  Microsoft's
main accomplishment was in providing a short-term solution that could
bridge between the old and the new business worlds.  100% of the
thought leadership of today's modern Internet came from the fringe
community, and they've literally eaten away anything of value that was
left over by the proprietary software culture.

Literally, Adobe helped by simply getting out of the way.  Microsoft
helped by becoming irrelevant.  That is, once they've provided the
bridge between the old and the new worlds.  In that sense, they were
pivotal in bringing the old world to the new world.
