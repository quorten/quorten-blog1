High tension wires?  What does Wikipedia have to say about that?
First its a link to a music album.  Second, it's a redirect to
overhead power line.  Well, that sure is weird, surely it reflects one
of the biases of Wikipedia somehow.

Strain insulators, insulators that can accept tension or compression
force, were a later invention.  Very early power lines couldn't use
higher voltages because of they lack of strain insulators.

What is particularly interesting about insulator mention here,
something that I didn't think too much about before.  Rain is a
particular risk to the efficiency of the insulators, so they must have
special mechanical designs that sweep away as much water as possible,
minimizing the risk of major shorts.  However, the risk is still
there, of course simply because of the water washing cover.

Interesting.  Harse opposition to building a new powerline, but
ultimately the guerrilla tactics failed.

Interesting.  Wireless powerline sensor.  So, sometimes additional
sensors are placed on the powerlines directly, not just on the utility
poles.  Power might be scavenged from the powerline, and data might be
transmitted on the powerline too, which is then intercepted by the
utility pole, that then has a larger antenna for remote
communications.
