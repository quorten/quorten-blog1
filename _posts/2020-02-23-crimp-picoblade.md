A few months back, I bought some Molex PicoBlade housings and pins but
no means to crimp them.  Many times I was searching for more
information on crimping them, but haven't quite found what I needed.
But now, I finally found what I was looking for.  An affordable,
universal crimping tool for micro connectors.

What is the general name of the game?  Generally, "trapezoidal
crimping" tools are what you can use for crimping connectors similar
to Molex PicoBlade.  Here is a variety of oversized crimping tools
inside this product catalog, for example.

So, here's my deal pick, the Engineer PA-09.  Great price and
relatively easy to use.  That expensive Molex tool that is recommended
in the Digi-Key links?  That is the "production-grade" tool for making
lots and lots of crimps quickly and efficiently, hence the higher
price tag, not to mention the higher need for lubrication maintenance
on that more complex tool.

Alas, now I discovered that I could have bought the readymade Molex
PicoBlade cables had I known better.  Alas, I must admit, the ability
to crimp on connectors is very important if you want to repair or
modularize some existing electronics that were originally cheaply made
in China.
