3D computer animation notes.  Notes about entertainment industry, the
media, limitations in human logical decision making, and how to avoid
letting those biases leak through to computer systems that we want to
make logical decisions.

* The media is biased.  So, you ask, what makes a "good" song or a
  "good" movie in the entertainment industry?  Well, one that is
  entertaining, of course, and for the matter of fact that there is
  such a distinction definition, we know that what you end up seeing
  from the "professional media" is indeed quite biased.  What both
  music and animation share in common.  And video, and movies.  Not
  just any random sequence of data, will do, and for this reason, this
  is one of the reasons why it is so much harder to predict whether
  some commercially developed entertainment will be a box office hit
  or a box office flop.

    * The difference between data that is to be "ingested by a
      computing machine" versus what is most entertaining.  If you are
      training a machine, you really do want it to receive a stream of
      unbiased information, otherwise its logical decision-making
      capabilities will be erroneous.

      Actually, as a matter of fact, it is just as bad for humans to
      be fed with a long stream of entertainment as it is for
      computers.  Indeed, in both cases, it causes the intelligent
      subject to tend to think irrational thoughts.

    * But, were it the case that were humans not so biased and more
      permissive and liking of even but random sequences, then the
      world would be revolutionized.  Entertainment industry would be
      much more predictable and economically sustainable.

    * The human biases of only paying attention to certain types of
      information that are considered most "entertaining" work against
      human logical reasoning.  First, the attention source is biased.
      Second, as a consequential damage, the range of information
      available inside the human brain for decision making becomes
      biased.

      "Garbage in, garbage out" as is often said in the field of
      computing.  As it turns out, the large amount of entertainment
      data contained inside of computers is the "garbage in."  The
      problem that happened here is that humans tend to photograph and
      film only those scenes that are thought to be most entertaining
      to themselves.  The rest is not recorded, in the interest of
      minimizing storage space requirements.  Of course, it would have
      been much better to perform a statistically unbiased random
      sampling of the world via a video camera, were the purpose to be
      to view the world from a logical perspective.

    * Yeah, like seriously, you know, what "security cameras" end up
      seeing almost every single day.  A large, long stream of
      uneventful pictures.

    * So, on one hand, "entertainment engineering" can be used to grab
      people's attention, then educate them on a statistically sound
      view of the world.  On the other hand, it can be used to help
      spread misinformation and generate mass hysteria, along with
      other crowd mentalities.  And I think we can all agree that for
      the mass majority of "entertainment," it is designed with solely
      that motive: to be entertaining, regardless of logical
      interpretation.  So the "on the other hand" is in fact the most
      widely observed effect of entertainment.

    * So what is emotion?  Emotion is attention, and one of a very
      narrowly defined set of states.  Yes, a finite state machine.
      How about that?  Yes, actually, in some sense.  Although,
      similarly related, pain or discomfort causes attention too.

    * So, now you're asking.  What about entertainment?  The
      interesting thing is that in essence, the things that entertain
      people have not really changed over the thousands of years.
      Despite technogical advancements, many of the newer forms of
      entertainment are simply mapping reductions to existing,
      lower-tech forms.

      At least for the mass majority of people, that is.  Yes, there
      is a counterpoint.  On one hand, there is _mass entertainment_,
      and on the other hand, there are specialties.

      So, this is what I was going to say, now that I have set the
      scene with context information.  The thing is that all humans
      have some in-built biases in how they pay attention to things.
      Sure, humans can be trained away from these biases, but the fact
      that these are so pervasively in-built says something
      interesting.

      Traditionally, some of these tendencies, such as paying
      attention to moving objects, had their advantages.  Why not just
      watch the grass grow?  Well, if there is an animal charging
      right at you, it might be more useful to take notice.

      But, in the modern era, these tendencies can be used against
      humans, especially when exploited through technology.  Now,
      technology does not remotely need to have the same connctions in
      behavior and operation as is the case in the natural world.  VR
      objects flying at you might not actually hit you.  So it's
      important to understand the virtualization of sensations so as
      to logically react to them, or conversely, ignore them.  Not
      just virtualization, but I should say, in better words, more
      importantly, the artificial engineered nature of the senses.
      Yes, like "entertainment engineering," or perhaps better put,
      social engineering.

    * Ha ha!  "Why not just the grass grow?"  That's a funny question
      to go asking in the middle of this technical document.

    * Professional entertainers.  They get paid to grab people's
      attention, and that is how they sell.  So, it can't be
      "ordinary," and unfortunately that makes their business model
      less predictable too.

* Statistical decision making, and how humans are so bad at it.  Well,
  duh, given the discussion just above, I think you should know that
  all quite well.

* So, you say.  Your productivity output for writing text far exceeds
  your productivity for music?  But that's because I don't have to
  listen through the text to make sure the rate is just right, unlike
  the case for music.  Hey, maybe you can automate that, can't you?
  Then you'd speed your productivity way up, right?  Well, I guess so.
  Hey, that makes sense.  But then it brings into question.  Why even
  make a huge collection when just a small amount will do, right?

* Again, I reiterate.  With archives, more is always better!  You want
  to provide artists with the largest selection of available assets.

* Discussion about _digerati_.  Who they are, and why you should be
  careful about trying to repeat their "experiments."  Portability,
  and associated costs with experiments.

* So, about "entertainment industry."  Well, now I'm thinking, maybe
  it is only applicable to mass media ones and those that rely heavily
  on technology.

    * Mass media is a phenomenon in that it relies on language
      synchronization among a mass community.  Obviously a reality in
      the United States, but this cannot be expected to be the case
      elsewhere in the world.  The local regional languages might be
      much more fragmented.

* So, music is just entirely "fictionalized" by humans?  Like just a
  random play of experiments?  Well, that's not entirely the case.
  There's also a statistical element to it.
