Being "a world class software platform" (Linux, WebKit, Microsoft
Office, and so on) appears to come at a considerable price in terms of
code quality and bloat.

The OpenBSD community takes it upon themself that by being relatively
obscure, they can put a greater emphasis on quality than is the
standard for "world class software platforms."

In essence, what I am doing is gradually putting together a
miniaturized "BSD-like" operating system, again in hopes that doing so
will allow me to have a greater focus on quality than is possible in
the bigger, more mainstream projects.

Now, all that being said, another thing that is interested to think
about in relation is the IKEA effect: the perception that things that
you need to do some of your own effort are of higher quality than
things bought readymade.

But alas, this is where the specifics of the facts come into play.  In
software development, if you are using "ready-mades," that means you
are basically restricted to using very large and complex software
libraries, trying to tout in themselves that they are a software
platform.  The problem is that this kind of software simply just
doesn't fit on a traditional PC microcomputer.  Even the most trivial
of programs will be terribly bloated and exceed the memory capacities
of your system!

For this reason, most software written for early 8-bit PC
microcomputers was almost exclusively written by only a single
programmer.  It had to be, lest they produce too much code too fit
into the system.  With only one programmer overseeing the whole
ordeal, they had full control over restricting what code gets included
and excluded from the software, so as to optimize it for the specifics
of the highly limited computer system.

So, returning to the IKEA effect in thid discussion, sure, it wholly
applies if you are talking the large computer systems only.  But for
small computer systems, do-it-yourself does have a considerable
benefit and payoff.
