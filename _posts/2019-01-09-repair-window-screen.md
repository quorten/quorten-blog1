Got a broken window screen?  Windows are big, and so are the screens,
so don't throw it out if you can repair it instead.  Repairing a
window screen is actually quite easy so long as the frame is intact.
All that is required is removing the old molding, called "spline," so
that you can remove or reposition the screen and insert new spline.
If merely an edge is detached, you can reuse the old screen, but if
there are holes in the screen, then you need to cut new screen to
position inthe frame.  Old spline should not be reused, so I am told,
because it hardens over time, becomes brittle, and looses its
stickiness.

Do you need a spline roller to insert the new spline?  Not so, but
inserting spline is faster if you have one.  If you don't have one,
simply do it the old way by using a hammer and nail to pound it in.
