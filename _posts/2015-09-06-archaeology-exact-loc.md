Very important.  In archeology, the exact location where an object is
found must be recorded.  Usually the horizonal location, and sometimes
the vertical location.  Also, as for best practices recommendations
with Asman, the date should also be recorded.  And this information
should be exposed in a human readable format, again, for best
practices.  When possible, the tag should be assigned directly to the
object in question, to avoid the tag getting lost in relation to the
object.  Otherwise, the best that can be done is to place the tag
within the object's proximity.

Archeology.

Whoops!  I've misspelled archaeology, have I?  This is the actual way
that I wanted to spell it in my writings.
