Interesting video on recapping capacitors in a Macintosh 20SC Hard
Disk power supply here.  Also useful for learning some general
electronics techniques, and it was good that voltmeter and
oscilloscope readings were used throughout.

The result?  Well, yeah, the result did work okay, but I was not
impressed with the performance compared to the original.  Yeah, "if it
ain't broke, don't fix it" is still the side that I am on... though
apparently there were already some leaky capacitors.  But, what makes
me feel bummed about this.  Dang, that Sony engineering, they really
know how to build with craftsmanship, absolutely no corner cutting on
the quality whatsoever.  They put all their cards down to make the
product of their work as maintainable as possible for whatever future
generations may come to.  No wonder why Macintosh computers hardly had
any malfunctioning problems back in the day, while PCs were wrought
with hardware AND software problems that would cause random freezing,
crashing, and rebooting.
