So, previously, I've mentioned the possibility of setting up a 3D
scanner so rather than having the object rotated on a turntable, the
scanner itself rotates around the object.  This has the advantage of
not needing to worry about soft objects shifting in their shape as the
turntable is rotated?  Are there disadvantages?  Yes, there are.  What
are the principle disadvantages?  The principle disadvantage is that
such scanner designs require more space to setup: all of the clearance
between the camera and light source to the object must be replicated
360 degrees around the object platform.  On the other hand, a
turntable scanner only needs such clearance instantiated once.
Therefore, all of the area otherwise consumed for the turn-scanner is
freed up for other uses.  This is particularly useful for scanning
large objects as otherwise the available room space can get quite
tight with a turn-scanner design.  That is, when you don't own the
entire room for the sake of the scanner itself, but are bringing the
scanner into a room not intended for that primary purpose.
