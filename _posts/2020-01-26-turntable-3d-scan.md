So, previously, I've mentioned the possibility of setting up a 3D
scanner so rather than having the object rotated on a turntable, the
scanner itself rotates around the object.  This has the advantage of
not needing to worry about soft objects shifting in their shape as the
turntable is rotated?  Are there disadvantages?  Yes, there are.  What
are the principle disadvantages?
