So I started looking into this article about "first jobs" being at
risk because they are easily automated, but then I found it leads to
Wall Street Journal.  Okay, but it's the blog, not an article, so it
should be alright, right?  Wrong.  Even the Wall Street Journal blog
posts are behind a paywall.  "Well, then, what's the point of calling
it a blog?" I wonder.

Wall Street Journal article about the decline of motor vehicles among
the younger generations.  Article about first jobs being easily
automated.  Surely, these articles are designed for an older reader
base?  How about an article about how the younger generations are not
reading the Wall Street Journal?  That is a subject reserved for third
party websites to discuss, such as this one.

Wow, now this is interesting.  Here I see an article that head-on
headbutts some of what I said was previously covered by the Wall
Street Journal.  So they're wrong, that is what this article writer
thinks.  It's not a trend that started before the recession, it truly
is the economic divide that is reducing car ownership, not a reduction
in interest.

And yes, again, sadly we must reiterate how the great American middle
class is fading away.  Now, here's the thing.  Most of the financial
hardships of the younger generations are due most directly to growing
income inequality.  The cleavage into the 20% comfortable Finance,
Technology, Engineering, and Medical sector (FTEM) living a
comfortable life with a bright outlook for the future (with
limitations for the medical sector), and the 80% low-wage sector where
the future is dim and finances are tight.
