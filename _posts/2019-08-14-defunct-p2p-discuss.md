Very seldom do you hear the general public talk about advanced
software technology.  And when they do, they often times have a
twisted and highly inaccurate understanding of how the technology
works.  The old order of peer-to-peer software operating during the
late 1990s and early 2000s couldn't be a better example.  For the most
part, in modern times, peer-to-peer software has fallen out of the
purview of the mainstream media and is largely considered defunct in
popular culture.  At least that's what my understanding is.  For all
peer-to-peer software that has entered the purview of popular culture,
all of it was shut down by court orders.  Virtually all of the
remaining peer-to-peer software operating in the modern era is
somewhere deep within geekdom: Windows software updates, Blizzard
Updater for World of Warcraft, open-source software updates, content
distribution network nodes, and so on.

As for the Wikipedia articles on the subjects, there is clearly a
subjective bias on standpoint, leaning more heavily toward the geek
culture than the mainstream culture, but a read through the Talk pages
does bring in more of the viewpoint of popular culture.
