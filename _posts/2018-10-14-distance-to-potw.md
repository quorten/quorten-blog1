Interesting.  So, you're wondering.  How far is it between a typical
city and the sewage treatment plant (Publicly Owned Treatment Works
(POTW))?  Well, this article does cover some metrics for one city,
Raleigh, North Carolina.  Basically, a typical sewage treatment plant
is huge.  It may be in the middle of a giant farming district, serving
the combined output of many cities.
