Important!  What is the advantage of a traditional DSLR camera over a
light field camera?  The primary advantage is the optical viewfinder.
A light field camera requires digital processing to create a visible
image, but a traditional SLR camera produces an excellent image that
is visible within the optical viewfinder, no electronics required.
Going for a mirrorless camera?  There isn't much advantage of a
mirrorless camera over a light field camera, perhaps only in lower
energy consumption.
