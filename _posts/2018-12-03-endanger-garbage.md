"Least concern."  Does Wikipedia have an article on that?  Indeed, it
does.  It's part of the IUCN Red List.  Interestingly, the IUCN Red
List has a formal study of the endangerment status of humans.  It's
pretty interesting to see some of the environmental living parameters
of humans lined up with animals.  Particularly, humans can't habitate
swamp areas very well.

Great Pacific garbage patch?  Now, this is interesting.  Although the
plastic garbage patch covers a large area, most of the garbage is not
visible to the eye.  Most of the contents are microplastics.  The
original plastics photodegraded from sun exposure, so they therefore
slowly broke down into smaller and smaller pieces of plastic.  Also,
note that there is more than one such garbage patch, but one of them
is the biggest, of course.

Indeed, if you look at this picture of plastic garbage waste, you can
see that most of the contents are indeed some sort of food container
of a sort.
