You know those descriptions of computers on Wikipedia?  Yeah, at face
value, they make things sound easier than they really are.  Like, how
do you boot a Macintosh computer?  You need a boot disk.  Without one,
you can't do anything useful with a Macintosh computer.  Alas, the
Macintosh was designed to work with significantly larger amounts of
data than the microcomputers that came before it such as the Apple II,
so it makes sense that you would need to insert a disk into the
computer before it is usable.
