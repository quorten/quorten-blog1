Serverspec and Testinfra are some ways to test your infrastructure
configuration code.  Molecule is somewhat of a newer system that could
possibly be useful.  And now we have another name in our game: Inspec.
Inspec supports Serverspec-style testing, but it is better and
provides other doodads and widgets that I am not entirely familiar
with.  Nevertheless, our team is using it.
