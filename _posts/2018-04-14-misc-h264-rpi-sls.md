Important!  H.264?  The successor is H.265.

* But, the future is not so clear as is the case with H.264.  There
  are concerns over patent royalties and quite a number of
  alternatives currently (2018) available.

Old news, I think this is the same thing I saw about libre boot of
Raspberry Pi.

Interesting.  Space garbage trucks.  Robotic tools to track space junk
is curiously a "challenge" to track a non-communicating object.

Interesting but not quite related.  A computationally powerful
alternative to Raspberry Pi.

Important!  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  The
importance of patent expiration in growing the market share of a tool
or technology.

The SLS patent expired, but the market growth is less clear than in
the case of FDM.  And by all means of 2018, those predictions turned
out to be correct.
