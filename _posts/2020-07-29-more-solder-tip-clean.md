Sure, I've already taken notes on cleaning soldering iron tips, but I
feel I need better notes.  So, here we have it, better info to our
avail, from Weller.

* Cleaning your soldering iron tip with a wet sponge puts stress on
  the tip due to the thermal expansion and contraction, it causes
  metal fatigue that can cause it to fail earlier.  It's therefore
  better to use brass wool (softer), or steel wool (a harder abraisive
  on the tip, it can wear out the tip but the wool lasts longer).

  That being said... I've noticed that you can use a dry paper towel
  for cleaning solder tips, if you only need to clean off mild
  oxidation on the tinned surface.  Just don't hold the solder tip on
  the same position too long otherwise it will char the paper towel.

* Avoid using liquid flux directly to clean the tip because it is
  corrosive.  Especially, do not use water-soluble fluxes because they
  can damage the tip at high temperatures.  Additionally, using
  water-soluble flux for touch-up work will also hasten tip failure.

* If a little oxide has built up on the tip, you can use
  rosin-activated core solder to get it off.  The stronger flux is
  required, no-clean flux will not clean the oxide off the tip.

* Again, tip reactivator is a last resort if all else fails.
