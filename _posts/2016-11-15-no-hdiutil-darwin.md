Okay, so I looked again at the Apple open-source website, and it looks
like there actually isn't `hdiutil` in Darwin.  It's just referenced
many, many times, albeit not being directly available.  I guess I
could try to talk to Apple about this, but you know how they'll
respond.  Oh, yeah, that's bad.  So, it's something that is only on
Mac OS X.
