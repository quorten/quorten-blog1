Sure, if you're in my boat, you know the only one, true, authentic,
and _de jure_ way to obtain Windows 98 is on a physical CD, either as
unsold stock or on the used goods market.  But, if your target is
virtualization, what if you want to eschew with the redundant physical
round-tripping?  Well, then suffice it to say, you can go searching
around on the Internet, and what you will find for sourcing will keep
changing from one year to the next.  This is what I found from a
search this year.

Noteworthy is that only the OEM Windows 98 discs will boot, according
to this site.
