This is a really great discussion about Autodesk's attitude toward
Maya and the like in 3D art.  Really strong on engineering, sure, but
3D art they seem weak.  The idea of unification across products, heck
that never played out in all these years, just that they bought and
killed off SoftImage XSI, and many 3D art folks are still missing it.
Yeah, I miss it too, I only visited their website once and read about
them from the periphery, but yeah you can see in its heyday it was
used in some important movies and the like.

Oh, wait, but here's the real explanation behind what was happening
with XSI.

Wow, now that's a really interesting back-story.
