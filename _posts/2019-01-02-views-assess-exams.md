Assessment, examination, exams... something that I've done a lot
during school days, but now I hardly ever do it.  What does Wikipedia
have to say about examination?  A few things.  One, examination was
hardly ever done in the earlier days of schooling.  Examination is
very much a modern phenomenon after World War II.  Another thing that
it called out specifically was "teaching the test": instead of trying
to teach the overall course curriculum, instructors may narrow their
courses to only emphasize what matters for doing well on the test.
Indeed, this is the same problem that we know about that comes from
"whiteboarding," the defective method of assesssing software developer
recruits during job interviews.  Another interesting mention was that
of the "high-stakes test," where failures are often associated with
major life setbacks.a

Is examination a waste of time?  Well, I can't really find any
empirical evidence on this question, but these are some opinions on
the subject.
