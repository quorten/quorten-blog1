Here we go again, circling around to this subject that typically leads
nowhere.  Trying to use genetics to predict differences in income, it
can explain no more than 2% of income differences.  Suffice it to say,
in general the differences are negligible compared to larger scale
environmental factors.

Now the paper at the end concludes with something meaningful:

> If you want to address poor people getting sick and dying while the
> wealthy aim towards living forever, increase access to health care,
> and improve working and living conditions. Ignore the 2 percent
> effect and focus on taxing the top 1 percent of people who own more
> wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. That will actually help.

Well... the goal mentioned is audacious, but the means to the end?
Well, that deserves further discussion.

But, I have to agree.  For most people, if the goal mentioned was
their goal in life, our world would be a very different place.
