So, I saw that Inkscape had a GitHub repository that points to GitLab.
Did it move after the Microsoft acquisition?  No, it was always there.
It moved from Bazaar and Launchpad to Git and GitLab.

So, now I'm wondering.  Would GitLab work for me?  Looks like it
would, as there is a GitLab pages analog to the GitHub Pages of
GitHub.
