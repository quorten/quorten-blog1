How is film developed?  Oh, that's how.  It requires lots of dangerous
chemicals to develop and fix the image.

* Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  I searched for this
  and found it, that means it's important!

Can it be done automatically?  Definitely.  The Wikipedia article says
that's how it's done in commercial film processing.  Ideally, you want
to scan your own developed films so that you can get the highest
resolution.

I'm interested in very high resolution imagery.

This is insightful, not for my particular question, but from a general
standpoint.

Again, the flatbed scanner turned into a digital camera.

Okay, that's it.  I'm assuming there's nothing else out there on the
Internet on my subject, so I'm stopping.
