So, I'm wondering.  Really, I thought for sure I saw some software to
copy a disk image of a Macintosh hard drive, but I was initially
dismayed that it required copying over Ethernet.  Now that I'm
thinking again that I will be able to have TCP/IP networking set up
over a PPP serial connection, maybe it's not so bad after all.  Alas,
I cannot seem to quite find that software.  On the other hand, with
some more thought and searching on the subject, I came up with a
viable alternative.

Follow the trail of links to get to the jackpot.

Copy II Mac is the name of the software.  So there is already some
good old software that works on black and white Macintoshes for
copying the contents of one hard drive to another.  We'll get back to
that thought after the next research article.

This is an interesting and useful article.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  SCSI2SD is a great
modern technology adapter solution that allows you to use an SD card
in place of a traditional Macintosh SCSI hard drive.  Yes, indeed, the
old way was to buy an SCSI SSD + physical connector adapter to put
inside a Macintosh, but the technology quickly marched right on and
now using SD cards for all the storage is plenty viable.

Also, be careful about putting your Macintosh back together after
taking it apart.  One wrong move wiring up an expansion card and you
could toast it!

So, about that thought that we held off on.  You have a vintage
Macintosh hard drive as one of your drives that you source to Copy II
Mac, what do you use for the drive?  Easy, the SCSI2SD adapter.
Blissfully copy your hard drive to your modern SD card, then pop the
modern SD card into a modern computer to get instant access to the raw
disk image of the vintage Macintosh hard drive.

Oh, wait, wait, wait.  I was wrong, this software is not for copying
hard disk images, it is for copying floppy disk images.

Failed search.
