20180821/DuckDuckGo why is the professional media so conceited and
  rude toward amateurs

On the other hand, I found some very interesting article here.
Architects are facing a silen war?  Ah, very interesting.  Ah, so most
people don't understand architects' jobs, architects aren't getting
paid very much, they feel like their work is being undervalued.  And
the verdict?  Although they are smart, they are not as well-paid as
one might think, but the solution is for them to get better at
marketing themselves.  They are part of both the problem and the
solution.

Oh, and there's very interesting comments on this first article.

The story behind the diamond marketing strategy was very interesting
here.  There was a deliberate attempt to create a scarcity of supply,
and generate demand.  The plan to generate demand?  Market diamonds as
something not just for the rich, but for everyone at their marriage.
Ha, tricky method to generate a mass market.  And nowadays, people
hardly even question that the association of diamonds with love and
engagement are all merely but an artificial one, courtesy of an ads
marketing agency.
