After you're done with soldering, you're left with a solder sponge
with minute amounts of solder in it.  If you are using leaded solder,
that contains minute amounts of lead.  So, you shouldn't just throw
that in the trash, now should you?  Previously, I've searched for info
on this subject, and the consensus was this.  If you're just doing it
personally for hobby electronics, it's perfectly fine to throw it in
the trash, that's what your garbage and recycling companies will
typically instruct you on.  Because you're not a business, the
quantity isn't big enough to be a concern.  But, if you search for
"recycle solder waste," you will get a few options brought up.

So, the key to revisiting this subject.  Some recycling companies are
less generous than others in what they are willing to recycle.  Indium
Recycling does not recycle solder wipes, these have to be sent to a
different recycler.

On the other hand, Alpha Recycling Services does recycle solder wipes.
They will also recycle solder paste, so long as there is metal content
within it, so that's your go-to for recycling solder paste.  And, by
extension, you can ask them about recycling.  Brass solder scour pads
are also, in effect, copper with solder in it.
