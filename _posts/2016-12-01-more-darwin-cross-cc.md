Oh, really interesting.  Important updates on Darwin!  So, apparently,
it is possible to create Darwin on ARM.  And this is particularly
helpful because it indicates that you can cross build such a system
without an existing Mac OS X.  That's what we want.

Oh yeah, and I created lots of links of various disputes on the Talk
page on the Wikipedia article on Darwin.

Oh, and a link to the closure of the Darwin project.  Is it really
true that it failed?  Or is that just what the administrators say
because they didn't meet their personal goals?
