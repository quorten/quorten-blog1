Oh, interesting.  HP's Multi-Jet Fusion (MJF) is another method
similar to high-speed sintering.  However, it differs by the use of an
additional detailing agent, rather than only using a heating agent.

Also, you're wondering whether there are companies that are selling
High-Speed Sintering 3D printers in commercial production?  Indeed,
there is at least one: voxeljet, and there are rumors of others to
come such as Ricoh.
