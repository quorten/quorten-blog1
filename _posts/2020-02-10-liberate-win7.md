Wow, now this is a really interesting idea.  Campaign Microsoft to
release Windows 7 as libre software, now that it reached its "end of
life."  It doesn't have to die... they can just shift the stewardship
of it elsewhere.

It would be very interesting if this campaign did make it to full
fruition, but chances are that it will go pretty much nowhere,
unfortunately.
