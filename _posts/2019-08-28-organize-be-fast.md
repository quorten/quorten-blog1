One thing that I was thinking about in the midst of developing my
bootstrap operating system is race car drivers.  What is the one
personality trait that sets race car drivers apart from ordinary
people?  No, it is not speed in judgment or reflexes.  Actually, it is
an extreme urge to control their environment.  Their immediate
physical environment needs to be very structured and organized.  Of
course, because you can't move fast in a sloppy environment!

When I think about my bootstrap operating system and this together, I
realize this is exactly what I am doing.  I am trying to build a more
organized operating system, and matter of fact, whole software system,
so that it can be a suitable foundation upon which other people can
build to move faster than is possible in the existing, sloppy
operating systems nad software solutions.
