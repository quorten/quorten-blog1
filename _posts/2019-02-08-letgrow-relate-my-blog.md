So, normally I don't take any notes from the Let Grow blog (formerly
the Free Range Kids blog), but this time I found some articles
particularly relevant to the typical subjects in my blog.

250 Things to Do Instead of Homework!  Some of the subjects I cover in
my blog are very closely related to some of the subjects in this list.

Out of a comment in this article came a discussion about Google
controlling you through YouTube.  Yeah, the argument is interesting
and believable in some sense, but you know what?  I think we kind of
already know that people who are watching YouTube might just click
through anything at random, regardless of how well planned out it is
on the side of Google.  It's from a state of reduced consciousness
regardless of the displayed content, simply a new form of watching
random TV channels.  So, in a sense, the purported claims need to be
evaluated with a control group and an experimental group to validate
the hypothesis presented.
