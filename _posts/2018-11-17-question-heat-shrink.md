The question of heat shrink tubing.

Now, when it comes to building my circuits, I will be soldering
together wires and there will be solder joints.  How will I cover them
up?  Well, there are a lot of options here.  One option is to use
heat-shrink tubing.  The main disadvantage that I see here is the
possible complication in removing the heat shrink tubing.  Another
interesting option is cold-shrink tubing, which doesn't require the
application of heat for it to shrink.  Perhaps it's more convenient
for installation, but it still has the same problems when it comes to
removal.

Finally, perhaps my preferred and (personally) more traditional option
for now it to use wrap-around tape tabs.  I take a piece of tape, fold
it over on two edges to create and easy removal tabs, and wrap the
tape around the solder joint.  This provides insulation at the solder
joint, and removing it is as easy as pulling at the tape tabs.  Plus,
I don't have to buy any new special materials to get started on this
approach right away.
