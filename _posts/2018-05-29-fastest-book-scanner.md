So, earlier I've noted that my DSLR camera is practically limited to 1
exposure per second.  That's 1-2 pages per second.  I've also noted
that almost all photographic systems are limited to approximately this
speed due to digital bus bandwidth limits with today's technology.
So, what are the fastest book scanners available today?  Yep, your
assertion is true: approximately 3600 pages per hour is still the
practical limit.  A HowStuffWorks article from 2009 says that Google's
book scanner could scan 1000 pages per hour, which is not any faster
than hand-paging.  Wikipedia says the fastest is 2900 pages per hour.
So, yes.  Indeed we don't have scanners operating at 10 pages per
second or faster.  Not until we solve the digital data bus speed
problem.

As for automatic document feeder solutions, there are apparently some
that tout 200 pages per minute.  Of course on the digital side of
affairs, reduced resolution will need to be used due to bus speed
limits.

Also, we have another speed limit up and coming.  If you page through
book-style much faster than 10 pages per second, eventually air
resistance becomes the limiting factor, and the only way to go faster
is to page through the book in a vacuum chamber.  Actually, this even
holds true with an automatic document feed, otherwise the papers are
sliding sideways so quickly that they'd otherwise fly up and go
airborne, or air turbulence would tear the papers apart.

What would it take to scan a million pages an hour?  278 pages per
second.

Additionally, a really bright illumination source would need to be
used for the high-speed camera photography.  Now you realize that this
is a very high-powered system and expensive to operate just in terms
of the energy consumption!  How do you know where to stop?  That is,
in terms of technological complexity and sophistication.

* Footnote: What?!  Wikipedia says an operator can manually page
  through at 200 pages per minute?  Seriously, that can't work with
  all books, can it?

From the HowStuffWorks article, there are lots of pages on controversy
of Google book scanning.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Google's approach is
decurling pages via 3D scanning via infrared light.  The main
disadvantage is that there is simply less resolution at the areas that
are decurled, as opposed to photographing directly.  Faster, sure, but
also cheaper in terms of quality.  Plus, it's more expensive with the
additional scanner components.

Looking for a more efficient thermal transfer printer?  Solid ink
printers are the solution.
