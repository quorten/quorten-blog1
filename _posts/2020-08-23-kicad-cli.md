So, I'm maintaining a GitHub repository for a KiCad project.  I've
seen other projects use manual generation of PDF schematics to include
in the repository, but I'm interested in using a CI/CD pipeline.  to
build these derived artifacts non-interactively.  So, what are my
options?

Unlike Inkscape, KiCad does not have a direct command-line means to
run exports to your favorite file formats.  Instead, for Pcbnew, this
can be achieved through scripts, and for Eeschema, this can be
achieved through an external program, called `eeshow`.

Another note, right there on the external tools page is altium2kicad,
that should greatly ease collaboration with Altium projects.
