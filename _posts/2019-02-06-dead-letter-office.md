So, learning about RabbitMQ when reviewing a pull request from a
coworker, I catch mention of "dead letter exchange."  Surely, there
must be a greater meaning behind this, and indeed there is.  A dead
letter office is the place where undeliverable mail without a legible
return address is sent.  Here is where there are detectives that try
to discern information from either hints in the address labels or
hints from within the mail as to where the mail should be sent.
Historically, USPS was able to then deliver 40% of such mail sent to
the dead letter office.  The remainder would have valuables removed
and later be auctioned off.  It is the last part that makes the dead
letter office look curiously interesting.  Nowadays, USPS calls the
modern equivalent the "Mail Recovery Center."
