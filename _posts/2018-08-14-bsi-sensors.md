Back-side illuminated sensors?  They have their advantages in that the
active matrix is behind the photodiodes, but they have disadvantages
too, such as cross-talk.  Suffice it to say, the main advantages are
greater when the pixels are smaller, otherwise the active matrix
doesn't reflect too much light away from the photodiodes with larger
pixels.  That being said, these kinds of sensors are a major boon to
modern smartphones, but only used in some modern DSLR cameras.
