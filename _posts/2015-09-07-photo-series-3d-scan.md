Automatic 3D scanning with a series of photographs?  Not quite ready
for prime time.  As one particular example, for one particular
photogrammetry application, Photoscan, 256 GB of RAM "is not unheard
of for use with this program."

So, sounds like things are a long ways out.  At present, you might as
well use software that you develop yourself.  Or software that I've
developed myself.  Or software that I recommend that's been developed
by other people.  But beyond that, unless you are really skilled at
Internet search, you're not going to be able to turn up useful
results.

UPDATE 2019-11-23: The name of this game is "photogrammetry."
