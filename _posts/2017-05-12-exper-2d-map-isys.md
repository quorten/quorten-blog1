My experience using the 2D environment mapping technology:

* It's like you have 360 degree vision, you can see thumbnail images
  of every single viewpoint of the object from a single screen.

* It's like you have X-ray vision, you can see all layers of the
  object all at once.

* It's like you have multipresence, you can exist in multiple
  different rooms at the same time simply by opening up multiple
  browser windows.

* You do in fact have telepresence, since the experience is exactly
  the same both within the local vincity of the area and several
  hundred miles away from the area.

* I'm amazed with how quickly you can navigate the environment, you
  can navigate this point-and-click environment considerably faster
  than you navigated the physical environment when taking the
  pictures.

* This technique works excellently with "unstructured environments."
  That is, environments that are not organized into labeled and ID
  numbered shelves and rooms.

<!-- more -->

    * In fact, the technique works so well that it makes me believe
      that it can be used as a reasonable substitute for tagging and
      barcoding all objects.  It truly is "detached schema" as you
      would want to put it.  You can unambiguously tag data digitally
      to objects in the computer by using the photographs as a
      navigational aid to disambiguate "which object."

    * The technique works so well that it can be applied to extremely
      low-cost objects, objects where tagging them with RFIDs would be
      a prohibitive expense.  It even works well for objects that are
      so small that tagging them with barcodes would be a considerable
      difficulty, especially when it comes to reading the barcodes off
      of the object.

* The mapping between the real world navigation and the virtual world
  point-and-click navigation is a "natural mapping," it is readily
  obvious to a human user.  Even more so than ID numbered shelves and
  containers in a "structured environment."

* This technique is excellent for discovering and mapping out
  unfamiliar environments.  It is in fact a SLAM algorithm.

* I am amazed with the degree of precision at which is stored within
  the photographs.  The photographs capture so many details that you
  did not consciously think about at the time that you took them.  For
  example, even if you weren't paying attention to the exact
  organization of how objects were stored within a box, the
  photographs store so much awesome detail that you can in fact put
  the objects back into the box exactly as you have taken them out.

* Once you photograph and browse through the objects in the computer,
  your mind is free to think about so many more details than is the
  case when navigating the physical environment.  Yes, the fact that
  browsing the virtual environment is faster sure helps.

* Until recently, the technology wasn't advanced enough, but now we
  are there, so why not use it to your advantage?

    * Oh, I know, I know.  Technology complacency.  It's always an
      option that despite having the technology available right at
      their side, people might not choose to pick it up and use it.
      Unfortunately, as it turns out, some people just aren't as smart
      when it comes to using technology to their advantage.

But, the other consequences of this technology.

* Why won't people adopt it?  Sometimes it feels like your studying
  human psychology more than actual science.  The practical limits of
  human psychology.  Some people just naturally create more problems
  then they solve, and this is kind of one of those areas.  It is true
  that the human brain is biased in its processing dynamics, and this
  is one of those areas where the bias works against the human brain's
  computational power and efficiency rather than with it.

    * But the reality.  Why this has such a huge market potential for
      that reason.  The ability to capitalize on the weakness in human
      psychology and turn it into a monetizable business endeavor.
      The fact that the process works so well even for people
      exploring unfamiliar environments means that the process can be
      done fairly efficiently even by third parties.

        * Also, the fact that due to the ease of use of the system,
          the fact that it is harder to commit fraud with the system
          than to use the system honestly.  And the fact that, even if
          fraud is committed, it is very easy to detect by measuring
          the lack of data, through the amazing quality of unbiased
          imaging technology that records all practical limitations of
          the images contained therein.

* What are the deliverables in resulting data when this system is
  brought to the next level?  What kind of utility comes with that
  data in future decision making?

    * Tools and utilities.  What kinds of tools are used by humans?
      For what tasks?  How do they work?  Why did people use them?

    * Design quality.  Of the tools designed for specific tasks, which
      ones are of the best designs that maximize usability and which
      ones are the worst?

    * Scientific knowledge.  Is there scientific knowledge encoded in
      symbolic form in some information storage media?  This is useful
      to understand from a general perspective, also it helps decode
      literature written around the same time that references the
      associated symbolic language terms.

    * Human psychology.  What biases in human psychology result in
      corresponding biases to the surrounding artificial human
      environment?

    * Cultural.  Beyond intrinsic constants to human psychology, what
      are the arbitrary qualities intermittently held constant over
      short periods of time simply due to cultural norms?

        * Measurement of rate of cultural change and its corresponding
          lack of consistency.

            * Using the measured cultural change to make past
              information contexts interpretable by modern people who
              don't possess the cultural knowledge in their head.

              "Machine translation" in other words.

But, this is really important.  Let me summarize my analysis.  Who is
the environment mapping system useful to, and under what
circumstances?  Also, when is the system not useful?

* The system is not useful to people who have an excellent memory and
  familiarity with their surrounding environment.  So long as they
  always put objects back in their home locations, no external
  technology is needed.

* For people who are unfamiliar with environments, the technology
  provides a great way for them to explore and map out unfamiliar
  environments.

    * Also, the technology provides a great way to search for objects
      among forgetful people.  Or, more specifically, the search is
      initiated via text-based user input, and then linked data is
      used to associate the object with its graphical location.
      Naturally, the graphical location provides the user with a map
      on where to find the objects.

* For people who are forgetful, the system serves as a useful memory
  aid.

* Also, again touching back on the point of people who don't have
  memory of their environment.  Sometimes it's not that people are
  forgetful but that they are just unfamiliar with an environment.  If
  you want to train a large number of people to get familiar with a
  new environment quickly, especially at the micro-scale, this system
  provides an effective means to do so.

    * For the macro-scale, Google Street View (or similar) does the
      trick.

* Finally, the most unfortunate thing.  But the people who need the
  system most are least likely to naturally adopt it on their own!

    * Oh, its like personal fitness.  Yeah, totally, exactly.  Those
      people who are already pretty fit will gladly try adopting new
      technologies that purport to help you become more fit, but the
      unfit may not be so inclined as to even enroll themselves in the
      initiative.

    * The unfortunate reality of technology.  Today's computer
      technology is so powerful that it can solve virtually all the
      problems in the world!  If only people would apply the
      technology and use it...  and that's just the thing.  If people
      never pick up their smartphone and type in the search query,
      they will never tap into the wisdom of a greater being to help
      inform them to make a better decision.

* The system is great for helping people through times of great change
  such as during moving, to keep track of all the changes that have
  been made.

* Also the technology is useful for third-party auditing, to verify
  that no changes were made to the system, even by those people who
  don't have intimate memory of the system.
