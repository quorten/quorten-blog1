So, you're earlier questions about photo mapping individual papers?
The answer is obvious when you integrate with the digital library
methodology.  Of course, all individual sheets of paper must be
aggregated into larger bundles, such as reams of 500 sheets.  Now,
placing that into the photo map is easy.  The same principle can be
extended to smaller objects too, that they must be contained within
some kind of larger case together.

On the other side of affairs, in the scan to digital library world,
you want small objects to be aggregated together into larger objects,
but not too large all at once.  Papers should be packaged into reams
of no more than 500, then the reams can be placed on shelves or in
boxes for larger scale aggregation.
