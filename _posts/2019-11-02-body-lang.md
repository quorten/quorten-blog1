Oh wow, now this is an interesting article on body language and AI.
This time, it's not written by Vanessa Van Edwards herself, but by her
husband, even though it still credits the author as Vanessa Van
Edwards!  Nonetheless, it is a great interesting read from the
standpoint of explaining the computer technology in a way that the
more mainstream target reader of this particular site would
understand.
