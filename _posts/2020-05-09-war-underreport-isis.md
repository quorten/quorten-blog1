This is another article about the war in Iraq, ISIS involvement.
Again, the story is the same: The American people "are being lied to"
with false numbers understating the severity of the problems in the
situation.

This article, in particular, refers to air strikes that hit civilians,
but were not officially counted.

Related, that I found this from, was a Twitter account reporting on
deadly drone strikes.
