Can you read the contents of mask ROM with a microscope photograph?
Yes, here's how.  Depending on the type of mask ROM, you might need to
do some preliminary physical preparation beyond just opening the chip
case, like weathering away layers.  But in some cases, no preparation
is needed, and you can just photograph right away and look at the
components to determine the memory value.

This is also a very interesting website for a college class on reverse
engineering as a broader subject.

And, reading in even further, this was an experimental class, the
instructor was really busy to create and run the class, and also the
instructor has his own blog he maintains with his expertise in the
area.  There's also great backstory on how he got access to some of
the more expensive lab equipment.

And yes, on the class website, there are also photos taken during the
labs.  Again, this was an experimental class newly created.

Looking at the main page of the blog, now this is really interesting,
experimental camping stove fuel?  Well... reading to the comments at
the end, it is not as novel as the author may think it to be, in
Germany almost every store sells commercially gelled fuel, but can you
get it as easily in the U.S.?
