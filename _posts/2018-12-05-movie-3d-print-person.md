I happened to see a very interesting fragment of a larger show or
movie.  Some scientists discovered a fragment of a metal glove that
they found DNA on.  They then used that DNA to "3D print" a person.
The show then had a very interesting following after the print process
was complete.  The person screamed and struggled at the very
beginning, was confused as to why they were trapped inside a glass
tube chamber, then the people in charge of the process came to her,
showed her a badge, and started talking.  (Alas, I saw this on a TV
screen with no sound or closed captions.)  After showing her the
badge, she punched the sides of the glass tube broke through, and hit
the person on the other side showing her the badge.  The rest of the
tube was opened up, and the medical staff came in with wrenches in
hand of some sort.  She then made a break for escaping the room.

On the other side after escaping, the police started chasing after
her.  They cornered her, and on their police visors, they tried to
search for information on her.  "Select category: Person or Animal.
No file found."

So, now this is very interesting.  What was it that I saw?
Well, I go a-searching, on the channel I saw SYFY in the corner,
so surely that station name should have a website of a sort.  And
they do.  It has a schedule...

...but alas, they only allow you to see the future schedule.

Okay, now that wasn't much help because it didn't allow you
to view the schedule in the past.  So, here about I go to searching
on the greater Internet.

And indeed, I found something.

Reading carefully the show plots around the time that I recall seeing
it, I found out that the show in question is a movie, _The Fifth
Element_.

Now, this is very interesting as I realize I was watching the segment
with thoughts of it that are much different in hindsight.  The movie
was released in 1997.  3D printing as we know it nowadays wasn't even
a thing back then.  Yes, there were industrial users, but the
fundamental concept wasn't yet a mass-market one on any imaginable
level.  So, definitely it's one thing out of movies that sometimes
becomes more of a hit long after it was originally produced and
released.

The 3D printed person in the movie was portrayed as an alien given the
name Leeloo.  The actor in question that portrayed the 3D printed
person is Milla Jovovich.  Interestingly, Milla Jovovich says that
acting as Leeloo in _The Fifth Element_ was her favorite role.
