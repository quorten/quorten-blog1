So, DSLR camera flashes sometimes tout that they are "Thyristor
triggered."  What exactly is a Thyristor?  Basically, it is a
solid-state circuit that is similar to a transistor, but it _only_
acts as an on-off switch.  There is no mode in between where it can
act as an amplifier for an analaog signal.  Also, they are more rugged
for larger voltage swings than transistors and MOSFETs.
