Ah, so I heard that IBM is acquiring Red Hat.  Do we have more
information about this on the Internet.  Well, well, this is what I've
found.  Not much, really.  But the point in hand that I'll emphasize.
First of all, IBM has been involved in open-source for quite some
time, so in some sense they are prepared to acquire Red Hat and keep
it running as it should.  Second, IBM is the bigger company of the
two, by a lot, so it makes sense that IBM would be the buyer rather
than Red Hat, unless Red Hat only bought but a segment of IBM.
Finally, we know which of the two companies is the bigger name in
today's world.  Interestingly, it's not a requirement to be the
biggest company in order to be the biggest name.
