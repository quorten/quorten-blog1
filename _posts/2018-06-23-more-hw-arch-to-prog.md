Looking for other hardware with more processor architectures to
program?  Of note, my brother bought an Xbox 360 but doesn't really
use it much anymore.  That runs a PowerPC CPU, so that's more hardware
to experiment upon with Linux syscalls on PowerPC.  Then I would have
been able to cover minimal Linux syscall library testing with the
following processor architectures:

Easy to reach, physically, literally:

* i386
* x86-64
* MIPS
* ARM

Harder to reach, physically, literally:

* PowerPC

These are some omissions that I lament leaving off the list, but must
due to the admittable rarity of the hardware:

* MC68000

Yeah, I do have 68k CPU equipment, it's just that it's all too
lightweight to run Linux.  Not enough RAM, hence it's out of the
picture.

<!-- more -->

Here is other notable hardware left off the list, but I am not at all
concerned about omitting it.

* Alpha
* Berkeley RISC
* Itanium
* PA-RISC
* POWER (RS/6000)
* VAX

"Honorable mentions," things that I must include in the "not
concerned" list due to lack of hardware, but I would like to include
in the "lament" list due to the popularity of the name.

* SPARC

These are tiny 8-bit or 16-bit processors that are interesting to
program, but cannot run Linux:

* 6502
* 65C02
* 65C816
* Z80
* 8088
* 80286

* TMS9900
* 8502
