3D scanning notes.  3D scanner notes.  So, you ask, what kinds of uses
does a low-cost 3D scanner have?  Medical uses, of course.  There are
lots of medical uses for such devices.  Yeah, but that's like saying
that X-ray photography has lots of medical and dentistry uses, which
it indeed does.  However, if you're like most people, you don't end up
getting an X-ray every day, unlike may be the case with using your
smartphone or computer.  So, this is a rather shallow argument.  What
remains true that can be said is that these devices are indeed useful,
it's just that they tend to more have niche uses rather than
mass-market, everyday, consumer electronic uses.
