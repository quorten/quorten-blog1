Tracing the development of the Raspberry Pi camera lens.  First,
people started "hacking" the standard camera module by manually
removing the IR filter.  The resulting applications were widely
popular, and the community kept asking about a way to get the camera
module without the IR filter to remove barriers, so eventually,
Raspberry Pi foundation was able to negotiate with their supplying
manufacturer, Sunny, to setup a dedicated manufacturing line that
produced the camera modules without the IR filter.
