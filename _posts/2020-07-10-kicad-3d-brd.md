How do you export a 3D board model in old versions of KiCad?  The
trick is that in Pcbnew, you can export the board as a VRML file.
Then, you can import the mesh inside of Blender, MeshLab, or some
other software for 3D meshes.  Before important into CAD software like
FreeCAD, you're going to have to cleanup the meshes first.  Then you
can import into FreeCAD and export as STEP files if you so wish...
but for my workflow, generic 3D modeling software works fine.  From
there I can visualize the mechanical CAD structural layout and do
raytracing renders to get photorealistic depictions of the product,
model the fit within a larger system, etc.

And, oh, IGES... wow how I never worked with IGES in years nor has
Blender native support for it or any other common 3D modeling software
I used, but hey, I am still finding more name-drops of it.

need some mesh cleanup first, since the models and board are not
guaranteed to be nice manifold meshes.
