So you're wondering about height and life expectancy?  With all
variables controlled, height is correlated with lower life expectancy.
However, this does not explain the full causation.  Shorter height is
pretty well understood to cause less illness in older age.  However,
only possession of certain genes such as the Methuselah gene, which
causes less of a particular growth growth hormone, insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF1), is definitely a cause of greater life expectencies.

Also, as it turns out, healthy birth conditions have a stronger effect
on life expectancy than adult lifestyle variations.

Finally, due to the number of spurious variables involved, you can't
use height as the sole variable for your own life expectancy
assessment.  So, as we might say, don't worry about being too tall.
