So, this got me wondering.  A coworker was talking to another coworker
about going to a pool party.  "What swimsuit should I wear?  One piece
or two piece?" she asked.  Ah, seemingly a silly question... wear
whatever swimsuit you like, right?  However, one of the reasons for
asking was because she was unsure of whether one decision might
be... "incorrect."

But, anyways, this got me wondering.  What kind of swimsuit do women
prefer to wear?  Earlier, we've got the evidence that beach volleyball
athlete women prefer to wear bikinis or two-piece swimsuits while
playing, rather than one-piece suits, the justification being that
there is less places for sand to get trapped and it is otherwise
simply more comfortable.

So... the bigger picture here is quite interesting.  A poll from 2013
of American women is the reference.  As it turns out, even in general,
women "prefer" to wear the style of two-piece swimsuits.  (Takinis
have the majority in wearers over bikinis.)  However, out of the 53%
who wear one-piece swimsuits, only 9% said they "prefer" that style of
swimsuit.

So, the big difference between the athletes and the laypeople?
Self-consciousness about body shape and size.  The athletes have no
worry since they know they are "in shape," so they wear what they
want, what they prefer.  The laypeople may not be as in shape, but
most importantly they especially feel bad about it, hence tilting
their decision to wear a style of swimsuit that they don't prefer, but
think "is better suited to their body."

Very interesting when you think about it.  Put it this way, perhaps
it's one thing that don't like about having a modern office job.
Compared to the alternatives of more physically demanding jobs that
could be worked where exercise is not "extra."
