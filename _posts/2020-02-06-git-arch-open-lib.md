The GitHub Archiving Project is coming along.  At this stage of the
production of the archival artifacts, it's going to take a month to
complete.  In the meantime, they are looking for more contributions to
the guide at the beginning of every film reel.

Online digital libraries listing every single book in the world?
Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Here we circle back to
OpenLibrary.  Apparently, because they've made the most progress out
of anyone else, more so than, WorldCat, for example.  Yes, they are
part of the Internet Archive.

And, they have a means by which you can sponsor a book to appear in
the Open Library.  Sponsoring a book includes the digitization cost
and expedites its inclusion compared to book donations.  Ideally, the
books are available in the library forever... but of course, there are
always rare reasons why a book might get removed from a library for
legal reasons.
