Interesting, the GPL cooperation commitment.  This was started by Red
Hat.  Why?  Historically, it was considered a best practice in GPLv2
enforcement to take a cooperative approach when infringers were found.
When they were first notified, the goal was to make it clear to help
them come into compliance, not to sue them for money.  Apparently, and
unfortunately, there have been some cases where this was not the
approach.  Also, license reinstatement is made unambiguously clear in
GPLv2.  The goal of hte GPL cooperation committment is to
unambiguously state that companies and software developers stand by
the historic best practice for GPL enforcement, so as to add more
predictability to how it is enforced.
