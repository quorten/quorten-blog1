There has been an uptick of Coronavirus in America, after reopening
rolls out.  Yep, we know what needs to be done, but it's still not
coordinated enough.  America is a "big mess."  Yeah, disorganized.
Were the deaths needless?  Definitely.  Comparing with Germany, three
times as many per capita one million.  391 versus 109.  And among
blacks, one out of every 1500 about, have died.

Another significant point is fear that bar closures causes parties to
move "underground."  That is, private house parties that are
responsible for the spreading.  And, that increased spreading among
young people can cross over and spread to old people, especially among
multi-generational households.

Our hope is that young adults get the message: Even though they're
less at risk, they're getting it and they're putting a huge dent in
the numbers.
