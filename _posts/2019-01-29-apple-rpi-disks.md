Well, the title of this article basically says it all.  I did some
random reading on the Register, and found articles along the subject
lines of Apple saying you can't sue them for software updates that
slow down, Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+ RPi PoE woes, and
multi-terabyte disk drives more reliable.

So, the Apple class action lawsuit brought up some interesting
analogies.  Is Apple like the builder you bring into your house that
messes things up under contract, or is Apple like a vampire?  Also, it
is rightfully so that Apple claims the battery is only covered under
warranty for 12 months, but in the perspective of a $1000 device, is
it really justified that the entire device should be considered broken
by the end of a year?

About the Raspberry Pi article.  So, one intersting thing was the
speed upgrade to the compute module.  The compute module's speed was
only sped up to the limits of the original power supply
specifications, which is good.  But also, the upgrade to the compute
module was considered "the last of the 40nm line," which is also good
news that the Raspberry Pi Foundation will be coming out with a whole
line of new and improved Raspberry Pis.  At least the Raspberry Pi
Zero was held constant and good after the camera module addition.

As for the Raspberry Pi PoE woes, that is really unfortunate.  Well,
at least I didn't try to get myself involved in that sticky situation.
