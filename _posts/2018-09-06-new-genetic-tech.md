Interesting article here about a new technique for genetic
engineering: gene editing, called TALEN.  The way this technology
works is by using proteins to section in on a specific part of DNA,
and cut DNA at that point.  When the DNA heals, this will typically
result in the removal of the gene at that point.  Alternatively, new
DNA can be spliced in.  This is different than genetic engineering of
times past that used bacteria and viruses to introduce DNA from other
species.  Matter of fact, gene removal can easily happen on its own in
nature, so this form of genetic modification is much less invasive and
dangerous than methods of times past, not to mention more specific.

But, the most interesting part of this article discussion was the
backlash that the public has generally had toward genetic engineering
in food.  It's the reason why non-genetically modified food is a
multi-billion dollar industry.  There is a very interesting quote at
the end of the article from one of the farmers who is piloting the
genetically modified crops on his field, Bob Braun:

> I think you can go back to any time in human history and find people
> who were afraid of change.  When I was a kid, I used to hear the
> old-timers complaining about tractors.

So, what I learned from that: There were people who were complaining
about tractors?  Wow, I always thought farmers loved tractors.
