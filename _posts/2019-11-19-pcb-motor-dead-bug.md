Here are two useful articles I've read from IEEE Spectrum that are
useful for organizing with the rest of my electronics blog
information.  You can construct small, low-power DC motors via a
printed circuit board: the motor windings are trace patterns printed
onto your circuit board.

The second one, the "dead bug" approach to constructing prototype
high-speed circuits.  You can't construct high-speed circuits on a
conventional perfboard because you don't have a large grounding plane.
So instead, you can use an unprinted circuit board as your large
ground plane, and wire together your IC chips directly, with them
upside-down like "deada bugs."
