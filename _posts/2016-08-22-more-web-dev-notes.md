Okay, so more important software notes on web development.  Gunicorn,
CherryPy, django, Ruby on Rails, RAML, Haml.  OpenShift, Docker,
Jenkins, Vagrant, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, AWS, MongoDB, OAuth.

But do you know what's most interesting about Haml?  It starts by
mounting some criticisms against HTML, whereas in fact these are
criticisms against XML, and XML was created in response to criticisms
against SGML, namely, the complexity of the grammar and parsing
algorithms.  And here we go again, right back in the same direction
where we came from.
