Is persistence really a good quality of success?  "Keep at it."
Actutally, no.  Matter of fact, it is one of the least important, but
people like to overemphasize it, especially adults.  Why?  The "sunk
cost fallacy."  Adults are particularly prone to being affected by
this, but childern are completely immune.  The idea is that if you've
invested a lot of work into something, then you should keep working at
it and it will come to fruition much sooner than would starting all
over do.  As it turns out, this is not true.  Often times, people's
success is not related to how much work they put in, but to their
substantiated conditions.  To be totally blunt, such "demographic"
substantiated conditions are by far the biggest thing that can be
statistically measured and proven out to scale across multiple people,
not just anecdotal evidence particular to one person.  So yes, it
turns out that if you want to be successful, you should start by
choosing the areas that have the best success rates.  That is the best
success factor.  Compared to the weight of this factor, the effort you
put in is relatively "small," but that doesn't mean you should expect
to get all the way through with very little effort, as might be the
assumption of some smarter students who generally aren't mentally
challenged by school.

* Important!  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  This is
  a great way to deliver career decision-making advice.
