Wow, I've suspected this for quite some time, but I didn't see
stronger verification until now: In the old days, people didn't really
know exactly how old they were because they didn't create accurate
birth certificates.  But, it goes further than that.  Most people who
claim to live to the age of 110 are probably making false claims,
sometimes even fraudulent ones.
