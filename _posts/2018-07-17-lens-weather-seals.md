Pentax K-1 camera notes.

I'm wondering.  It it possible to weather seal an old manual zoom
lens?  It would be really nice to use that on my DSLR camera, but I'm
concerned about it sucking dust into the camera and getting on the
sensor.

Failed search.

Interesting points here.  Bottom line: Don't worry about dust inside
your lens, it makes no difference to your photographic quality.  A
bug, spider, or screw in your lens, that could be something of worry.
However, even then, that may not make any difference to your
photographic quality.  Point in hand, impurities within lenses do not
have the detrimental effect on photographic quality like they do on
the DSLR sensor filter, so relax and feel free to use your old lenses!
Well... as long as they do not suck dust in that gets on your sensor
filter.

It's very interesting how debunk these Lens Rental people put
"internet wisdom" to the test here.  Some of it is true, other of it
is... well, not quite as specific as it could be.

Wow, this is interesting.  PC Magazine also does a review on Pentax
gear?  Indeed they do, and they point out what differentiates it.

Now this is really interesting.  Lens Rentals found a fly inside a
weather sealed zoom lens, and it didn't make any noticeable difference
on the quality of photos the lens took.  Nevertheless, they
disassembled the lens to get the fly out (otherwise their customers
would complain), and it took 4 hours.
