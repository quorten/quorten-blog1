Wow, now this is interesting.  A trivial virus leveraging functions
largely from other software evades detection by antivirus software,
and is very difficult to detect in its own right.  The spreading is
very successful for this reason.

Google admits that the Google Nest's technical specifications should
have stated that it contains a microphone, but the original ones
didn't.  That was an "error" on their part.  Nevertheless, in the
modern era of consumer privacy suspicion, this is a very
eyebrow-raising error.  Not to mention the product development and
release standards that led up to this error... "higher-level" software
developers are well-known for littering their software with many more
bugs than microcontroller firmware engineers, so it comes as no
surprise that the hardware's documented specifications showcased this
same level of inaccuracy.

Beyond smart thermostats, Google also has a similar Internet of Things
suite of smoke detectors, security cameras, and camera doorbells.  Of
course, be forewarned that they are not meant to undergo the same
rigor of traditional embedded device development for these gadgets, or
even the same level of mere simplicity.
