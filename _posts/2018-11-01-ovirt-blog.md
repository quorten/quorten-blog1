So, now I find oVirt to be quite interesting, and I've found there's
also an oVirt.  So, what is the news on oVirt at this time?  Anything
interesting recently?  Well, I wouldn't say that there has yet been
any interesting release activity.  However, I've found some
interesting technical articles on the oVirt blog detailing some of the
lower-level technical details of the system.
