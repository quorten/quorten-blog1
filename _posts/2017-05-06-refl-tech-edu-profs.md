* About the whole science thing.  So why the science education in
  schools?  Oh, we are told from IEEE Spectrum that scientists are a
  much more political bunch than engineers.  No wonder why they got
  "science" into the school curriculum.  And no wonder why they lobby
  on the streets in Washington D.C. but engineers don't.

* `inven-sys` On the spatial inventory system and navigation.  Why
  constrain the user to a physical metaphor?  They should be able to
  open up different rooms in different windows and drag and drop to
  move objects around, not have to move around.  Like a so-called
  "spatial file manager."

* Oh my goodness.  The problem with mass media.  Yeah, it's like you
  said, it's all in the marketing.  But also like you were thinking
  previously but did not yet write down.  The reality of the media
  appeal and cultural relation among people?  What causes people to
  take some reactions as complements and others as insults?  Why do
  they just want to "enjoy" a story?  Why don't they want to
  understand the technical reality of language translation?  Why do
  they just want to hear the story in their own language?  It's like
  people looking at themself in the mirror.  What they see is that
  echoes their own self and psychology is "good."  "But it's not
  real!" you say.  Yeah, but that **is** the reality entertainment.
  It's not about looking at things objectively as they actually occur
  in the real world whether they like them or not.  It's about seeing
  what they want to see, it's the "pick and choose" culture of looking
  at what interests you.

    * Wow, so that's where those mal-guided career guidance counselors
      got that idea from.  No wonder why they promoted a software that
      said "Find careers that interest you" in it.

* About the medical profession thing.  When it feels like all
  technology is doing is tracking the limitations of human psychology
  but not going further.  Yeah, that's why 3D video really hasn't
  taken off.  I mean, binocular vision, technically.

  In a post-industrialized society, 3D printing doesn't have much
  economic activity in manufacturing, so where to go next?  Well, it
  has medical applications, so why not capitalize there?  Yep, so
  that's why you hear so much emphasis there.  Because the medical
  profession's employment generally scales with the human population,
  barring any dramatic super-automation going on at work.

  Yeah, but ...  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  The
  one thing that I don't like about the medical professions is not
  only is its growth controlled by the human population, but so it the
  case in the limitation of the different medical segments and
  specialties.  The fact that it does so closely track human
  population demographics can also result in some unusual changes,
  like pharmacy employment booming then busting when the baby boomers
  come and go from the elderly population.  But with technology, the
  tides and forces of change are different, not tracking the human
  population but instead tracking the state of the art of technology.

    * The industry pulled out of the sector so quickly that nobody had
      time to write high-quality libre software CAD.  Let's put it
      that way as to why development of libre software tends to fall
      behind that of proprietary software when it comes to CAD.
      Whereas, for more mainstream software, there is no shortage of
      libre software, precisely because there is a bigger economy
      behind it, thus there is more sponsored development in that
      sector in general.

* Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  American math
  education is behind the international standard.  That is perhaps one
  of the most significant differences between American education and
  education elsewhere in the world.

    * Why does this matter in this context?  Well, it matters because
      all of this is mathematically intensive, which is likely to
      cause troubles for Americans.

* Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Hobbyist
  mathematicians have made considerably useful contributions to the
  state-of-the-art.  Like Oliver Heaviside who simplified Maxwell's
  equations or Delanalay Triangulations.

Renote.  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!
