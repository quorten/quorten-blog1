Okay, so this is really interesting.  You know that one GitHub
repository for migrating out of GitHub?  Well, over the course of a
few days, several people have posted discussion comments in the
Issues, the original maintainer got fed up, decided to delete all
Issues, disable Issues, reset the Git repository to the previous
revision, and then...  went silent for a few days.  In the meantime,
discussion from community members has since moved to a successor
GitHub repository maintained by someone else.

The point in hand is that the first maintainer wasn't prepared to
handled so much growth so quickly.

Luckily, however, not all is lost, despite the heavy deleting that has
gone on and the final disable of Issues.  Before Issues were disabled
and brought down totally, another community member has thoughtfully
exported and archived the GitHub issues to this GitLab repository.

Yes, this is the same user that posted a pull request to the original
repository to link to the new one, Serphentas.  Very thoughtful of
her/them.

UPDATE: 2018-07-26

The original maintainer has resumed activity and re-enabled the
issues, so you can now see them again, and things are much more
orderly now.
