This is an interesting article on unlocking an Arwing code portion
built into the _Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ Nintendo 64

the methods to unlock this hack without a GameShark?  Wow.

N.B. The _Ocarina of Time_ Nintendo 64 game was in-development for a

technologies were already developed and in their prime.
