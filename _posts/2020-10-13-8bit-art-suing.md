This is interesting.  A geek wanted to make an 8-bit version of a
music album, Kind of Blue.  They then wanted to complete it with a
pixelated low-def version of the original cover art.  Any questions of
the album rights were negotiated proper with the original artist, but
the cover art was not negotiated as it was believed to be fair use.
The professional photographer thought otherwise and threatened to sue.
The main intent?  It wasn't concern over copyright infringement per
se, it was that the original artist was a photography purist and
couldn't stand seeing a pixelated low-def version of his work
circulated on the Internet.  The case was settled out of court with an
expensive one-time payment of a couple tens of thousands of dollars
and a promise never to redistribute and reuse the artwork in the
future for that purpose.
