So, I'm wondering.  Where is a good Cat6A in-wall cabling speed test
tool available?  Unfortunately, all Ethernet cabling speed test tools
are relatively expensive.  For small-time use, your best speed-test
tool is simply using equipment that is capable of the higher speeds
and seeing if you can sustain a transfer at the maximum rate.
