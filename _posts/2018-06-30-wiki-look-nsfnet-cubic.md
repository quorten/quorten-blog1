Where was the Wikipedia article that talked about congestion on the
early NSFNET until the last node was upgraded to use cubic backoff?

Failed search.

I'm probably better off searching my existing notes than Wikipedia.
Nevertheless, I found some other interesting articles.  Indeed,
Wikipedia's bias is evident here.
