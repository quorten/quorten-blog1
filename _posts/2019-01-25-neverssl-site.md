NeverSSL, a site committed to not using SSL so you can sign on through
public Wi-Fi networks.  Interesting that we do have a site setup for
this, as otherwise those connection intercepting Wi-Fi gateways to get
you to go through an agreement or payment portal would just never work
with modern web security.
