So, I happened to catch mention of Lawson software as some very old
mainframe accounting software.  What does Wikipedia have to say about
that?  Nothing, it's too old to be heard of by the youngsters who
redact older, "non-notable" information from Wikipedia that does not
have "reliable sources" to cite.  But. if you go searching abroad on
the Internet, you will find a blog and some articles written by such
an old-timer who has had first-hand experience with the times in which
that software was relevant, Naomi Bloom.  Wow, things sure were
different back then in the mainframe days, and what a journey we've
went on to get into the modern era!

Infor bought Lawson Software.  Interestingly, Infor is known to be the
"ERP graveyard" among some circles, this company that buys out
software to scoop up some of the revenue from the existing market, but
eventually kills off the old software.
