What is the current status of VML?  Well, let's check back at the
Wikipedia article on it that I checked before.  And the verdict... it
hasn't changed!  But, my understanding of it has, as I have apparently
misread the Wikipedia article the first time through.  Even though VML
is included in the Office Open XML specification, it is specifically
marked as deprecated: new applications should not be using it, though
they may have support for loading the legacy data format from existing
files.  Browser support for VML in was dropped in Internet Explorer
version 10.  Therefore, the last remnants of VML have been erased from
the modern world... 6 years ago.
