Wondering about changing DSLR camera lenses in the field?  Are people
who are doing that using something like a changing bag, like what was
used for good old film developing?  Well, no actually.  They have a
different trick up their sleeve: do the DSLR lens changes blindly
under a jacket, putting their arms through the sleeve holes.  Ah,
tricky.  Now it would be an even more tricky idea if you used that
same trick for successfully developing film in the field.

This page has some useful tips for keeping dust off the sensor when
changing lenses, nothing out of the ordinary.  Noteworthy is that it
has an "emergency tip": if you can't get dust off the sensor, try
shooting a wider apertures.  Also, it recommends regular cleaning of
the sensor.  However, nowadays thanks to in-camera sensor cleaning
mechanisms, this is not as necessary as it previously was, where you
might clean the sensor by blowing it off at the end of every photo
shooting day.

Particularly, it also has a link to an old but interesting sensor
cleaning article.  Hence I had to consult the Internet Archive Wayback
Machine to get at it.  Noteworthy in this article is an explanation of
how dust can get "welded on," which is typically due to humidity
changes apparently.  Only when dust is "welded on" will you need to do
a wet clean, otherwise a dry clean will do the trick.  Also, in-camera
sensor cleaning mechanisms are basically almost as effective as any
dry clean.  Keeping your camera in a sealed bag with minimal air when
going between different humidity and moisture environments really
helps.

Also noteworthy in this article is the mention that you may need to
use different wet cleaning solutions based off of what your sensor's
filter coatings are.

Now, that being said, I better find out chemicals are required for wet
cleaning of the Pentax K-1 sensor.  "Sensor Gel Stick" is one thing
that is recommended and apparently works well.  Apparently "Eclipse2"
doesn't give good results.

Oh, and especially good tip here on Pentax Forums.  Yes, even the new
D FA zoom lenses specifically design for DSLR cameras stil have the
problem with sucking in air and blowing dust out onto the sensor.  So,
remember that buying new zoom lenses may not give you a considerable
advantage in minimizing dust over your old, existing,
non-weather-sealed zoom lenses.

Very interesting here, minor corrections made to the review on the
Pentax K-1 Mark II from this site.
