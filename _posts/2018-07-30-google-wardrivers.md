So, how quickly can Google's wardriver fleet scan the continental
United States?

Failed search.

Well, that search led nowhere, so let's try Google.  And indeed,
Google knows more about itself than the competition.

Ah, this is a great interview with a Google driver.  Some important
notes:

* It turns out these drivers aren't actually employed by Google, they
  are contracted out by a different company that employs them.

* Many of the drivers are temp workers, many scan only their local
  area, rather than being a professional fleet coming only from
  Mountain View, California.

* Indeed, bird poop on the cameras is a problem that the Google
  drivers encounter.  When that happens, they need to rescan the
  affected area.

* Neighborhoods are not frequently driven because they are not popular
  roads to drive that people are interested in.  Often times they get
  scanned only by coincidence when passing through to get to a new
  area.

* The "higher-ups" make a lot of the decisions of what areas to scan
  and how frequently.  Generally, the more popular areas are targeted.
  This is why many areas only have old maps or no maps at all.

* Driving speeds?  No faster than 30 - 45 mph works best for the
  cameras when it can be done safely, otherwise they drive the speed
  limit.

* Lots of weird things are caught on camera, and often times the
  drivers are forced to redrive areas when this happens.

* The tall cameras do get stuck in things and that is a problem.

* When not driving, the cameras are taken down and stored in the
  interior.

* The drivers are required to do some maintenance on the cameras.

* Also, the drivers are required to do some blurring out of the images
  and review of the images themselves.

* The Google cars must be uniformed but the drivers do not have to be.

* How fast is the upload?  Actually it takes 6 months to a year, as of
  2013.  So, pretty slow for a scan job as it turns out.

* The scan cars are **not** self-driving.

* The Google drivers try to avoid bad areas, but sometimes they get
  hit on their windshields with rocks.

And interestingly, sometimes the Google Street View scanners scan each
other.
