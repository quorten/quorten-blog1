Ah, I've almost had an important oversight.  Plaster is another good
material that does not burn.  Two formulations, clay-based and
gypsum-based, do not contain any carbon.  The limestone-based
formulation does contain carbon since linestone is calcium carbonate,
but don't worry about this burning.  However, plaster is not resistant
to very high temperatures: it can melt or otherwise decompose unless
it is designed to be heat-resistant.

And, of course!  I should have realized this.  Powder bed and inkjet
head 3D printing processes use a gypsum plaster powder and apply water
very much in a plaster-making process.  So, if you 3D print your
electronics cases with this material, you need not worry one bit about
flammability and fire retardants.

Vermiculite is a mineral rock that is popular for many aggregate or
concrete uses and does not contain carbon, enough said.

Mineral wool and asbestos are also fire resistant, but these ought to
be avoided due to their risk to human health.
