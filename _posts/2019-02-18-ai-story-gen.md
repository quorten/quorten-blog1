I found one very interesting subject from Twitter: a new AI to
continue stories where you left off.  This will be very useful to me
for some of my hobbies... once it is publicly released.  For now, they
are staying somewhat secretive about this technology for fear of it
spawning a new generation of fake news and fake reviews.

Here are two interesting articles on continuous partial attention.
