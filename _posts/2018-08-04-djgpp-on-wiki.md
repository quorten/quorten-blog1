What does Wikipedia have to say about DJGPP?  It was described as
"aging" in 2004.  Other than that, it doesn't say that much about
important users who used DJGPP for their products, like Quake,
firmware upgrade images, etc.

Of course, nowadays I imagine that standalone firmware upgrade images
will be running GNU/Linux nowadays, not FreeDOS + DJGPP.

Alas, these omissions have come from the hostile deletionist Wikipedia
culture.  The culprit can be traced down in the talk discussion and
the history.
