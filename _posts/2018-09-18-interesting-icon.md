Amidst a sea awash of Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Google
G-suite, Apple iPhone, Android... there is but one Raspberry Pi icon,
and very tiny at that.  Yes, now we're looking at the _really_ zoomed
out picture, beyond the formal partitions drawn.  It's about the big
picture, not about me.

Inside the Raspberry Pi is the even tinier partitions icon, with the
even tinier QR barcode.  And the spatial size of the icons must be
drawn to scale of the size of the markets.

Or how about this.  One icon of the biggest, and say "Drawn to scale."
That works well for a small icon.  Or, now this is interesting.  An
Earth with an Amazon icon over one of the continents.  Okay, let's go
with colors to keep it simple.  You'll get the idea better, and go
with a flat map.

UPDATE: So, here the icon is.
