In the middle of writing my bootstrap operating system, one thing that
I want to have is good documentation.  Out of all small public domain
projects targeting the key components of an operating system, I want
my project to stand out by being one of the best documented around.

But, there is an obstacle.  Sure, I can write my own documetnation,
but how do I know it's good?  The one true way is to have other people
review the documentation, not just myself.  It's easy to write good
automated tests for a new software project, but documentation review
is a major hurdle due to the need to immediately grow the community to
do a REAL review.
