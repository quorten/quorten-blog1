So why does Raspberry Pi use more than 3V?  Well, here's a good
answer.

20160731/http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/46765/why-do-the-pi-gpio-pins-use-give-3-3v-and-not-5v

* UPDATE 2019-11-20: The primary reason why Raspberry Pi Zero has 5 V
  power input is because that is the voltage that is required for USB
  and HDMI.  If you do not use those services, as I explain later, you
  can run straight off of 3 V.

JJJ TODO LINK TWO-WAY!!!
