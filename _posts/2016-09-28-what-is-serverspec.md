Serverspec?  Testinfra says that it is related to that.  Is this what
I'm looking for?

Need something more Pythonic than Cucumber?  Or, should I put it this
way, do you want something like Cucumber, but written in Python rather
than Ruby?  Well, then you can try this.

Why does it matter?  Oh, here, for some reason, people want to use
some "pure Python stack," whatever that means.  Well, okay, fine,
there you have it for the motivation.  For some reason, we just don't
like Ruby.
