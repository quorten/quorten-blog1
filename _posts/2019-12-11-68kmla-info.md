I went looking around on 68kMLA today and found some interesting info.

First of all, having trouble with garbage on the screen when booting a
Macintosh SE/30?  Try replacing the RAM SIMMs, they can sometimes go
bad and cause this.  Next up would be the address multiplexers.

This is a very interesting thread about various accelerator cards, one
containing an FPGA that generates the video expansion output.

Got some NiMH batteries that aren't doing so well and running out of
capacity?  Try putting them in the freezer overnight, take them out to
let them warm up for a couple of hours, then give them a long charge.
They may very likely be restored to almost full capacity.

Here is are some interesting information about a demo program that was
put together on the original Macintosh.  Technically, it was a lab
prototype 512K Macintosh, because the full demo software didn't fit on
the original 128K.  There's also some interesting information about
the origin of Macintalk.

Also, some of the other related stories on Folklore.org about the
release and demo are interesting.  Indeed, Steve Jobs was really in a
hurry to get the Macintosh product out the door without delays.

Wow, here's another interesting discussion on developing that new
userland AppleTalk driver stack.
