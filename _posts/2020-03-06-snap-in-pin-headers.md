When getting started with Raspberry Pi Zero, many times I was thinking
about and wishing for a such thing as snap-on pin headers.  It would
provide an easy solder-free way to breadboard with Raspberry Pi Zero.
Though I thought those didn't exist, those really are a living
reality, I just needed to know where to look.  Here is one example,
targeted at creating custom-sized Dual Inline Package (DIP) integrated
circuits (IC) sockets, but it can also be used with single pin header
wires so long as the prong is not too thick.  Snaps to the side of
plated through holes.

And here is the alternative that does not snap on.

And here is another alternative... I bought this one earlier thinking
that I could use it to create custom-sized pin headers, but it proved
to be too tight for that purpose.  However, for the purpose of
creating custom-sized DIP sockets, it works just fine.
