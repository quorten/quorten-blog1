Oh, very interesting.  The Game Boy and Game Boy color sold 118.69
million units worldwide in its lifetime.  Wow, that's almost as large
of a market as modern-day smartphones.

Of course, now that I think about it in hindsight... yeah, our family
definitely bought two, not one, Game Boy Colors well before we started
buying our first cellphones.  Before that, we bought two "toy" cell
phones, which were shaped like a real cellphone model, but the fancy
telecommunications circuitry was replaced by a tiny, cheap embedded
system that did nothing but play pre-recorded PCM waveform sound
sequences when different buttons were pushed.  In some sense, pretty
sophisticated for a toy as the sound quality was quite good, but the
embedded electronics circuitry was not quite good enough to be a real
cellphone.
