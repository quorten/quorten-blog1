Random software notes.

Xilinx is in bigger business with Microsoft nowadays now that interest
in FPGAs for cloud computer installations is surging, along with
higher-level software tools that don't require as much human engineer
involvement in the design process.  Intel was previously a big name in
this niche use of FPGAs, but now more established names like Xilinx
are making inroads too.
