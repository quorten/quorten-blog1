Well, well, after updating my Raspberry Pi 4 software, I'm still
seeing the video vertical synchronization tearing problem present.  I
thought they purportedly fixed that?  Well, I'm not seeing the
improvements.  Well, that's too bad, I better go searching around.  I
didn't find what I was looking for, but I found some other great news.

Finally, the Wikipedia article on number of Raspberry Pis sold has
been updated!  We're now at 30 million and counting!

The other thing, Raspbian has been renamed to Raspberry Pi OS, long
story short.  Wondering why updates to Raspbian were always so
sluggish when Raspberry Pi 4 hit the market?  Raspbian was never
officially chartered by the Raspberry Pi Foundation or Raspberry Pi
Trading.  Rather, it was a small but passionate community-led project
that shared a common interest in education and gained a foothold.  The
most significant customizations were to tune the kernel for the ARMv6
that is used in BCM2835 Raspberry Pi models.  Unlike Debian `armel`,
BCM2835 ARM has hardware floating point, but not NEON, fashpaths, and
some specialized ARMv7 scalar instructions.  So those kernel tunings
were necessary for optimal performance on Raspberry Pi, else stock
Debian would compile without any hardware floating point.

But now, with the 64-bit capabilities of the Raspberry Pi 4, those
kernel tuning customizations on top of the base Debian configuration
are no longer necessary.  And besides, Debian has straight-up support
for Raspberry Pi in `arm64` architecture.  Finally, the founder of
Raspbian asked that the name not be used on any distribution that does
not include these specific tuning enhancements.  Hence, the rename was
necessary, as there was also a necessary transfer of responsibility
that happened here.

But, the good news is, finally there is a fully unmodified, stock
mainstream GNU/Linux distribution that can run on Raspberry Pi, and
all the better that it is Debian!  That makes for a much better
foundation for building a libre GNU/Linux distribution.  So, now I
have some really good ideas and methods for moving forward on finally
getting virtualization up and running on my Raspberry Pi 4.

One last note, be careful of 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS upgrade, boot from
USB will not work from out of the box.  Run `sudo rpi-eeprom-update
-a` after upgrading to make sure everything is working alright.  That
is... if you have an 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS.
