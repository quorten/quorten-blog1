Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  The earlier article
I've cited about 3D TV?  Yes, indeed that article made a statement
that curved TV failed to live up to its hype promises.  But, for
posterity, let's search for that subject again for confirmation.  Yes,
indeed, we have a consumer reports research here that is really
interesting.  _Not only_ does it state that the curved screen doesn't
really improve viewing quality at all, but it also goes so far to say
that the curved TV screens are more expensive than the flat ones, and
at those increased price points, you'll be better off if you buy a
high quality flat screen rather than a lower quality curved screen.

Curved screens have a striking and novel appearance, but other than
that they don't really add any value.
