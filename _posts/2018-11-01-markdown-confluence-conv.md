Interesting Golang program here for taking Markdown source files and
publishing them onto a Confluence wiki.  Why would you want to do
this?  You might have a company wiki that is in Confluence, but that's
the only reason I can think of as to why you would ever be using
Confluence.

There is also another Markdown to Confluence converter, but this one
is written in Groovy, I believe, as it is written to be a Gradle
pipeline plugin.
