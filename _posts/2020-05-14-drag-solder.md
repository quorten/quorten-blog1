Looking for ways to solder those ultra-fine pitch integrated circuit
chips?  Now, here's a new nifty technique: drag soldering.  The trick
is to use a lot of flux, a fat soldering iron (yes. not a narrow tip
one), and to drag the soldering iron lengthwise to maximize surface
area back and forth across the pins.  You want to coat with just the
right amount of solder each time, not too much, and it will all work
out, with the right amount of experimentation to learn the technique
for different chips, that is.
