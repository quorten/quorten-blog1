So what about video hosting on Facebook?  Is Facebook loosing money
over their video hosting too or not?  Well, that's a challenge
question.  I would presume it is one of the things for sure that make
their business's finance tight.  They might have an effective lossy
compression scheme to throw away enough data to convince the user it
is okay, even when the quality is in fact horrible, similar to their
image hosting and uploading.

For sure they're not going for broke by offering to host larger videos
than they can pay for, unlike YouTube.
