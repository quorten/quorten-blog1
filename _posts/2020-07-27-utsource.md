When finding this random article on putting together a switched-mode
power supply system for the Raspberry Pi:

I found out about the site's sponsor, UTSource, another electronics
components distributor?  Yes, this one is Shenzen-based.  Looks like
they aim to compete in the same market as Digi-Key.  They started out
as a small business about 15 years ago, so they say, then they
gradually grew bigger to the business they are today.  So, definitely
not around as long as Digi-Key, but purportedly they grew much faster.
Yeah, but really, that sounds quite tongue-and-cheek to say 15 years
is "fast," right?  Definitely when compared with software, but the
electronics industry operates on a different time scale.

And... wait for it, they also have a PCB Builder service too!  When
did they get it?  Looking at the site history in the Internet Archive
Wayback Machine, looks like they sprouted it up several months before
Digi-Key.  However, they only do business with one PCB service
aggregator, NextPCB, and therefore their minimum order quantity is 5.
So, even though Digi-Key came late to the party with their PCB Builder
service, they came out with a competitive offering nonetheless.
