Looking for good Internet of Things sensors for a Raspberry Pi?  A
pressure sensor or "force sensor" is a great pick.  Great for precise,
specific information in formally built environments, and it doesn't
require much computation to gain the information either, unlike
cameras in an unstructured environment.

This is an "environment sensor": air pressure, temperature, things
like that.

Okay, this is a more heavy duty pressure sensor, not the kind of
platform sensor you'd be looking for.
