Today, I was wondering what J.R. Whipple was off to these days.  Oh,
no worry, I can just visit `jrwhipple.com` and see if he is still up
to the full time RVing.  So I go there, and I am met
with... disappointment.  There's just a landing page for a domain name
that no longer has any site registered to it.  Searching for
J.R. Whipple is also a disappointment.  Nowhere in the results is
anyone relevant to the original J.R. Whipple that I knew.

So, this is how the website of a small-company but ambitious computer
person ends.  Basically their entire identity gets wiped off the face
of the planet, and nobody really cares about them anymore, lest
remember them, and much less keep their historic site working.

So, for punctual accuracy, nostalgia, and simply a trip down memory
lane, here i go visit the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.  A
particularly interesting discovery here is a Windows extension called
"ultra-Windows" that adds virtual desktop support into your Windows XP
computer.

And, finally, the lead-up to the final fate of the website.  First:

> Our Server has suffered serious technical issues and our web site is
> currently offline.
>
> Until we are able to restore this site, please visit The Find-It Page

And the Find-It Page fails to impress, most of the useful information
is simply not there.

Looking further into the present, things get ever worse.  That
prognosis of the broken website continues exactly the same for another
two years.

Next even the page warning of the serious crash is now longer showing,
succumbing to an even more serious error.  And that's the end of it.

J.R. Whipple was indeed a considerable for me early in my electronics
hobby, first and foremost giving professional and skillful device for
working with PC internals.  Specifically, that you must use a
grounding strap and anti-static mat.  J.R. Whipple was also quite an
influence in being a high-tech computer guy who at the same time also
carried quite the reputation of a southwestern cowboy who you might
not expect to know very much about technology.  By all means, an
influential character in the personal dimension, by being curiously
uncommon in the tech industry.  But, like J.R. Whipple said himself
on his site:

> All good things must pass. J.R. has retired from the computer
> industry, and will soon be a full-time RVer.

And, well, now it's almost 4 years after becoming a full-time RVer,
and without the site or any other traces of contact, we have no other
way of knowing what he's off to next.
