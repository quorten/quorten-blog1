Okay, so you're winding down on your Windows purchases, but you still
feel you need that backup option in case you have the need to use
Windows for that bespoke software being a straggler on modernizing to
modern Unix-like web platforms.  So, what's the best way to approach
this?  Use Windows primarily as a virtual machine, of course.

The operating system on its own is designed for easy installation into
virtual machines.  The key, of course, is to make sure you buy the
right kind of license key with the necessary options for
virtualization.  In the basic case, you're only going to need to run
Windows 10 on one device, so you simply need to make sure you've got a
license purchased for that particular use.  In particular, Windows 10
Professional or better is required.

These are the minimum license options that are purchased when you buy
Windows 10 Professional:

* Windows Software Assurance (SA)
* Windows Virtual Desktop Access (VDA)
