Interesting history I've read from elsewhere on the SS Great Eastern.
This was the biggest steam ship at the time that it was built, 75% of
the Titanic, and only the third one ever built.  It had a passenger
capacity of 4000, and 5 steam engine "funnels."  Alas, one of the
funnels exploded, and ultimately only 4 funnels were used.  Also, it
never reached its full passenger carrying capacity, and by all means
was considered a commercial failure.  However, it was converted and
used to lay the first transatlantic undersea telegraph cables.
