With a DSLR camera, the time it takes to page through documents is the
limit on your scanning speed.  Paging through by hand, 2 seconds per
page is about as fast as you can get.  Scanning full-sized papers
actually isn't much faster than scanning film negatives.  And
definitely for film negatives, most people will want to page through
by hand rather than using some very expensive machine that may still
come with a greater risk of damage to the negatives.

As for paper documents, you may go faster with an automatic document
feed.  Of course, the risk assessment is up to you, whether you are
okay risking damage to the documents when they run through the ADF at
speed, versus slower but safer paging through by hand.
