SD cards from Amazon?  They were selling fakes here!

This is the best article I could find about fake SD cards.  So, for
purchases off of Amazon?  Make sure that it is shipped and sold from
Amazon, not some other company, in order to mitigate the risk of
fakes.

Wikipedia doesn't have much information on the subject of
counterfeits.

Again, this would always be interesting, but I must keep saying the
same thing.  It would be nice to have a single standard site for item
history, but for the time being that is something we can't rely on.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to see the various attempts made by
different people.
