Learning from some coworkers, I found a good independent home
inspection company called StructureTech, and they have a pretty nice
home inspection blog.  Here's a random sampling of some of the
articles I've read on their site.

So, one important thing that I wanted to point out that was good
advice from the blog was window condensation and whole-house
humidifiers.  If you are experiencing window condensation, then your
choices are to either try to better control the temperature of the
window (i.e. get it warmed up) or to reduce the humidity of the air
inside the house.  The problem about whole-house humidifiers is that
they can cause serious damage to the house if improperly installed.
Specifically, it's important to use automatic humidifiers that have an
outdoor temperature sensor to adaptively decrease the humidity when it
is really cold outside, in the interest of avoiding condensation
damage at the exterior walls and attic.

Here is one of a multitude of proprietary software solutions for
managing home information.  Interesting just to look at.

Furnace inspections, is it necessary to have a professional do it?  If
the professional is doing most of what may be expected of them, the
answer is yes, it is worth having a professional do it.  The typical
do-it-yourselfer is not going to do nearly as many things as the
professional does.

Some interesting things about plumbing here.  Unvented drains drain
faster than vented ones.  You know that neck you see underneath
faucets?  Sure, that might help catch solids to prevent them from
going down the drain, but that's not the primary purpose.  Actually,
the primary purpose is to trap water that blocks sewer gases from
coming out.
