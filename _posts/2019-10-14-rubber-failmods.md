Why does old rubber become hard and brittle?  Why does old rubber
become sticky and gooey?  I'll answer both questions here.

First of all, to reiterate, synthetic rubbers become brittle because
the plasticizers leak out into the atmosphere, which then wrecks other
havoc on nature, most significantly our own air we breathe.  In
particular, UV light exposure speeds up this process.  Rubber becomes
brittle in the the cold, deformations in that temperature can easily
crack and crumble it.  Rubber is also generally a thermoset plastic,
rather than a thermoplastic, so temperature extremes and wide
temperature range cycling can age it faster, making it become brittle
and crack.  Oxidation, simply exposure to oxygen and environmental
conditions that speed up chemical reactions such as high temperature,
is also another cause of rubber becoming brittle.  Oxidation affects
both natural and synthetic rubbers.  These phenomenon are generally
known as "dry rot."

Now, what about the other end, when rubber turns into goop?  As it
happens, all rubbers, synthetic or natural, start out as goop, and the
curing process is what turns them into the commercial variants we know
and love.  Essentially, when commercial rubber turns back into goop,
this is a "reversion" of the manufacturing process.  For recycling
rubber, this is a good thing, as it allows you to reuse the material
just the same as you would commercially.

But really, what causes the sticky breakdown?  The root cause is a
breakdown of the long crosslinks into short crosslinks.  Possible
environmental causes could be too must pressure exposure, acid/base
chemical exposure, gel content loss or decline, and to the extent that
it matters, high temperature exposure.  Presumably, high humidity,
especially when water vapor carries other chemical solvents, would be
a significant environmental factor that causes breakdown into goop.
