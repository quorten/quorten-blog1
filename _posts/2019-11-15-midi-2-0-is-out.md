MIDI 2.0 is finally out!  It's been quibbled about being in
development for so long, over 14 years!  And also, the long overdue
updates to the MIDI Manufacturers' Association website have also
finally come too.  Also, perhaps most importantly, no longer do you
have to buy a copy of the specification and get a printed book, but
now you can download the specification free from the website, albeit
free registration is required.  Also, the site is now titled the _MIDI
Association_ rather than the MIDI Manufacturers' Association.  Simply
put, the entire ordeal is much more modernized and up-to-date.
