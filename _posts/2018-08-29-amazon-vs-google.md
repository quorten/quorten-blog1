What information can we find in Google's billion dollar Android
business.

Failed search.

No, no, no.  We should be asking a different question.  Amazon has
their own modified FireOS based off of Android that they are using.
How is the competition between Google and Amazon going?

Wow, now this is interesting.  About Amazon's FireOS fork.  They
didn't entirely want it to be that way, they wanted to license Android
a little bit more like Google, but Google's licensing restrictions on
their official apps were too restrictive, so they were booted out of
the hardware market they wanted to get into and left to sell only
their own devices.  Then that's how FireOS became a flop, because of
lack of good hardware.

Indeed, Amazon and Google are direct competitors, in many many ways.

Wow, now this article has some pretty good insights.
