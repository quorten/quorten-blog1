What are those Z5U, Y5V, and C0G codes you see in the names of
capacitors on Digi-Key?  These are temperature operating range codes,
they specify what temperature range the capacitor is capable of
operating within and the variance in capacitance over that range.  Of
course, bigger temperature range ratings are more expensive, so only
buy if your electronics really need to withstand the wider temperature
range.

Of course, the other end of affairs is that all smaller package
electronics are also cheaper, so if you are going for surface-mount
capacitors, feel free to enjoy the larger operating temperature range
when you buy in that form factor!

Also note, this Digi-Key article is also instrumental in specifying
different classes of capacitors.  It's good to verify that the use
case your capacitors are rated for is the same as your intended
in-circuit use.
