When was OS/360 introduced?  1965 is when it shipped.  Wow, that's
sure a long time ago for an operating system that was so influential
on the world of modern computing: multitasking, compare and swap
thread locking for concurrency, virtualization (OS/370), and so on.

So, related to what you were thinking about, for older technologies
that got there first, but ultimately thrown by the wayside because
they didn't become as popular as the incompatible alternatives.  This
is it.  This is the pinnacle of your example of the thing happening
that you don't like.
