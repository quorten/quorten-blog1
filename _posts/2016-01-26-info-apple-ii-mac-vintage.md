Failed search.  Where was it written that the first order of business
was to play with the phone system?  Business users might be unappalled
to find this out.  I thought it was on apple2history.org, but my
search engine and my limited patience with a disfunctional search
engine.

Got it!  But I must admit, those modern web search engines sure are
defective and make easy things almost impossible to find.

24-Renaissance?

Oh yeah, and to reiterate this particular conclusion, discovery.  I
don't think I already wrote it down, though.  Why was the Apple IIe
finally retured in 1993?  Because Apple's second 8-year license to
Microsoft BASIC expired, and Apple was not interested in renewing it.
Why not?  Well, if you were to ask me, I would say that it was because
there already was a large market of BASIC runtimes available at the
time, some of which worked for their Macintosh computer.  And we know
for sure that Apple wanted to push their Macintosh computer as the
future of their company.

But wait!  The Apple IIe card was continued **longer** than the Apple II
computer?  I'm surprised they didn't get sued.  Well, I guess Apple
Computer really knew how to play their cards well to get a low-key
non-recognition from Microsoft as to what they were doing.  That
really leaves this point up to question.  Did Apple really not renew
their BASIC contract with Microsoft?

JJJ TODO Append a comment on the website!

Incidentally, this is also the reason why modern IBM PC clones do not
have BASIC built into the firmware, though this is a bit harder to
explain.  In this particular case, the clone manufacturers already had
to pay Microsoft per CPU sold for their license to MS-DOS/Windows, for
which they could not opt out of.  Furthermore, Microsoft was
presumably marketing their more advanced forms of BASIC running under
the operating system, rendering the ROM BASIC redundant and thus
obsolete for the purpose of licensing.  Especially with more
complicated computer hardware that required drivers under Windows to
operate, this traditional mode of operation continued to be a more and
more distant reality.

Anyways, hey, I was thinking about writing up some good questions to
ask and answer about having someone else read apple2history.org.
Well, that and research a little bit more about the surrounding time
frame and changes between computers of then and today.

Q: What is the S-100 bus?

A: It is the bus interface for the Altair 8800 computer.

Q: What is the most notable difference between an Apple II keyboard
   and a modern keyboard?  Why does the Apple II keyboard have this
   particular difference?

A: The Apple II keyboard is based off of a "teletype" keyboard rather
   than a "typewriter" keyboard.  Modern computer keyboards are
   derivatives of typewriter keyboards rather than teletype keyboards.

Q: What is the most significant change in the English language that
   has been caused by computers?  (Hint: This is related to the answer
   of the previous question.)

A: The elimination of homoglyphs.  That is, using the same typewriter
   key for the letter "l" when typing the number "1," and likewise for
   O and "0".  Typewriter keyboards traditionally did not have
   distinguished keys for these characters, but separate character
   codes were (and still are) absolutely mandatory for writing
   computer programs.  When computers were adopted at large in place
   of typewriters, the English language at large correspondingly lost
   these homoglyphs.  Note that handwritten English quite often relies
   on homoglyphs in practice, though homoglyphs in typed English has
   long since fallen out of use.

Q: What was the key innovation in the 6502 CPU that made it
   significantly cheaper than its competition?  Hint: Look in
   Wikipedia for the answer?  What was the business effect that this
   had on the competition?

A: Mask fixing: modifying the optical mask after it has been shrunken
   to fix errors introduced in the photographic process.  It caused
   the competition to grudgingly reduce their prices even though they
   could not manufacture their chips at that degree of efficiency.

Q: What were the various different consturctions and locations of the
   power button was located on Apple II computers?

A: In the original Apple II computer, the power button was a push
   toggle button.  I believe it was located on the front of the
   computer.  In later models of the Apple II computer, the power
   switch is a lever switch located on the back of the computer, right
   on the power supply.

   Why does this commentary matter?  Well, some people have criticized
   early Macintosh computers for having their power button on the back
   of the computer rather than the front.  For an Apple II computer,
   having the power button on the back of the computer wasn't all that
   bad, as it was generally assumed that the computer user would be
   working with the back of the computer considerably, rather than the
   modern business user who only works on the front of the computer.

Q: Why was the Apple IIe discontinued in 1993?  What is so special
   about this year in particular?

A: See answer above.  What is special about this year is that it marks
   the end of the second 8-year contract term for Microsoft BASIC.
   The primary reason why Apple did not continue would almost
   certainly be because they did not renew their BASIC license with
   Microsoft.  As has been noted in the book, without Applesoft BASIC
   loaded in ROM, the market for the Apple II computer would be
   destroyed.  As for why they may not have wanted to renew the
   contract with Microsoft, see above.

Q: What particular key font-rendering technology did Apple Computer
   invent that Microsoft later try to patent and claim that it was a
   totally new innovation?

A: Sub-pixel font rendering.  Microsoft tried to claim a patent on
   Microsoft's reinvention that they named ClearType.

Q: Take a look and some printed materials that you have.  What are the
   various column widths of the text on those materials?  How does
   that relate to the general amount of information in those
   materials?  Take an estimate of the total number of characters in
   those books.  How does that compare to the amount of memory in
   early Apple II computers?

A: Long textbooks are generally printed with column widths of 70
   columns or wider.  The number of characters in long textbooks (and
   even short ones!) generally exceeds the number of bytes of RAM
   available within the early Apple II computers.  How were books like
   these ever authored then in the early days of computers?
   Generally, they were authored in computers with much more memory
   like the Lisa and the Macintosh.  However, the software of the Lisa
   and Macintosh computers is so complex that it cannot be authored
   without the aid of a computer to design it in.  Hence, computers
   like the Apple II with the largest amount of possible memory
   installed were used to bootstrap the software environment of more
   powerful computers like the Lisa and Macintosh.

   Note that large mainframe computers were used to bootstrap the
   software running on an Apple II computer, to some extent.
   Actually, in fact, for all of the software running on the original
   Apple II computer, it was possible to author it all by hand using
   only pencil and paper, and then the numeric codes could be manually
   entered into a computer system, using a simple program-loader
   circuit that could be built by hand by soldering together discrete
   logic circuits.  Mainframe computers were largely used as a
   convenience in early Apple II computer development, but they were
   by no means necessary.  Mainframe, in this case, is basically
   discrete logic circuit elements wired together either by hand or by
   a semi-automated manufacturing process.

* Note: Although it is _possible_ to build a computer using discrete
  circuits such as relays, vaccum tubes, or discrete transistors, it
  is not _economic_ to build complex logic circuits using those
  elements.  It is excruciatingly hard to design a manufacturing
  process that that produce many of these elements that will be
  reliable in long-term operation.  With a large number of unreliable
  elements, the probability that the entire computer will fail is
  almost certain.  For this reason, if people had to start all over
  again building a computer from scratch, the first computer would be
  based off of integrated circuits, not relays, vacuum tubes, or
  discrete transistors, and certainly not mechanical gears.

* [Somewhat off-topic, this belongs in tour-de-force.]  Yes, the
  answer to the question.  How is it that your calculator seems to
  almost never make any mistakes?  This is the answer to the question.
  Rather than just traditional progressive improvement in
  manufacturing processes, a fundamental technology that is by
  definition far more reliable than anything that ever came before it.

Q: What do you think of this book for a business book reading?  Is it
   much more exciting than some of the other business books that you
   had to read?

A: I don't know, you have to answer this question yourself!  I have
   not had any boring business books as required reading for my
   computer science classes!

Q: List all of the fun and funny things that you find in the book.
   List all of the interesting business things that you find in the
   book.

A: This is your choice!

So, that being said about BASIC, the only direction forward would be
to try to find a replacement to Microsoft BASIC.  As it turns out, we
fortunately have plenty of choices for that today.

Oh, this is interesting.  I've stated many times how I hate how others
in the computing profession make such bad decisions, but you know
what?  There's nothing you can do to fix that, nothing you can do to
improve that.  Bad ALUs on the ENIAC?  Bloated modern web browsers?
You know what else?  Well, to some extent, these problems are caused
by employee turnover.  People keep ending up forgetting old knowledge
and things have to start all over.

Oh yeah, and I note.  Pages on the Apple II computer?  Those aren't
even remotely comparable to pages of text!  Yeah, I know.  The only
reason why they are called pages is because they are some sort of
blocks of memory.

More Apple II notes.  My favorite comment in particular, from Chapter
24-Renaissance?:

> First of all, consider Steve Jobs. In the eyes of many Apple II

Oh yeah, and about the days of making a million dollars on Apple II
software being over?  That's really interesting, because in the more
recent news, there is a lot of hype about how iPhone app developers
make a million dollars over their software.  Yes, and one day soon,
soon the iPhone will become as much of a thing of the past as the
Apple II computer.

Steve Jobs and his Macintosh.  Non-upgradable, non-expandable, just as
he liked it.  Well, even though it is not very good for owning at the
time, it does have one good effect: for future vintage collectors, you
know you can be sure of the exact details of the computer being
constant, based off of the model of the computer available.

Oh yeah, and how the Disk II "was almost obscenely profitable."  The
story of deception was also somewhat interesting.

Interesting parady of a girl who hacked into her Dad's Unix machine
remotely.  Yeah, then the Feds came after her, but in the end,
Microsoft wanted to hire her to help with debugging their Windows 95.

This one sounds really far-fetched: An edible Apple II wedding cake.
Wow, that's really over the top.  The chef did have to do a bit of
research in order to make the cake, and the back of the cake wasn't
accurately detailed.  The cake was built full-size, completely solid,
so it was really heavy.

JJJ TODO Come back to this one later!  Where was the photographer's
picture of the Apple II computer?  Oh, I don't know, but I can't load
all the pictures for this one, not right now, I'm afraid I might run
out of memory and my software will all crash.  Hence, I'll have to
come back to this one later, once I have everything all sorted out.

The photographer calls it an old school Mac, even though it is an
Apple II, not a Macintosh.  Though, I must admit, when I first heard
of the Apple II computer, I thought it was somehow related to the
Macintosh too.

Video games, shmideo games.  Well, anyways, this is something that the
author of apple2history.org has been unaware of, and for good reason!
But, I like how the author says that the town of Sierra on-line has
long ago been a gold rush town, but now is somewhat abandoned.  Oh,
and I really like that photograph of half-dome, iconic of Sierra's
company logo.

JJJ TODO Look more into this!
