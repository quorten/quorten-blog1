My bad experience with Google ReCAPTCHA customer support, I can affirm
this would very well apply with anyone whose used Google Cloud
Platform and got a nasty automated E-mail threatening to close their
account if they don't reply in a short period of time.

* Google has virtually zero customer support.  I can affirm that.

* Google sells their services to web developers and advertisers.
  Unfortunately, the other customer-facing services did not evolve.

* If you're not paying, you're not the customer, you are the product
  being sold.
