Interesting random information I've found here.

So, what happened here?  With all the fear of war in their midst, once
they saw a stray weather balloon, they mistaked it as an enemy
Japanese aircraft, then proceeded to fire at it.  With all the blitz
about them, they were unaware that all the warfare was of their own
side.  No enemies involved.
