Interesting article I've found here.  Self-driving cars should be
called "cryptocybers"?  Ha!  Why is that?  "Crypto" because the
driving mechanism is not understood by the layperson, "the driver is
hidden," and "cyber" because that is the actual correct word for
"driver."  "Automobile" cannot be used because that word has already
been used for manual driving car.

The problem with the name of self-driving cars: when almost all other
words are taken and repurposed for uses that are not entirely
consistent with their original meaning.
