"Concentrate"?  What does Wikipedia have to say about that?  Oh,
interesting.  First of all, the first few times searching, you get
directed to chemical articles or similar.  So then I try
"concentration," and indeed, I can finally get to the target article
through a disambiguation page.  Indeed, one of Wikipedia's biases are
showing clearly here.

So, some of the most key interesting points learned here:

* We already knew children have less attention control than adults.
  However, elders can have less attention control than younger adults.

* Attention control generally decreases across all mental disorders,
  especially executive control; that is, sensory conflict resolution.
