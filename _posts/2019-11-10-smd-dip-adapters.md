Got some integrated circuits that you'd love to use except that they
are in the stubborn surface mount device packaging?  Sometimes there
have been cases in the past where a third party manufacturer would
solder these onto through-hole boards, but too often those parts are
discontinued.  So, surely there's ought to be a more general adapter
approach available, shouldn't there?  Indeed, there is.  The most
advanced adapters have a full socket that makes it really easy to
insert your surface mount chips, but there are very few of these in
stock.  Far more common is a more bare circuit board approach where
you can solder on your surface-mount device to the adapter, the place
the adapter in your through-hole system.
