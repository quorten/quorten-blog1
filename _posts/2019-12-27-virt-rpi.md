Sure, you can run Docker containers on Raspberry Pi, but what about
some good traditional full system virtualization?  I mean, come on,
what better way is there to add a layer of secure isolation against
software security vulnerabilities than to run risky software in a
virtual machine like is done with web browsers?  Really, I heard that
Android uses virtual machines already.  Okay, okay, let's take a look.

Firs of all, this is a tough subject to search for because much of the
old information is coming in at the angle of virtualizing a Raspberry
Pi on an old skool x86 PC or laptop.

Here is some info on going the other way, running x86 programs on the
Raspberry Pi.  Alas, it recommends proprietary software.  But we're
interested in native ARM virtualization.

But, we're not interested in that, we're interested in defining the
Raspberry Pi to _be_ the desktop PC itself.  So, that takes a bit more
effort to search for that subject, but with some finessing, I've found
out that there is a way.  The trick is to use OpenSUSE for Raspberry
Pi, here you will find just what you need with KVM and virt-manager.

Ah, yes, here's a more detailed walkthrough on building your own
kernel with the hypervisor enabled, and getting KVM setup.
