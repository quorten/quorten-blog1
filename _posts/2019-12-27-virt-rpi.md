Sure, you can run Docker containers on Raspberry Pi, but what about
some good traditional full system virtualization?  I mean, come on,
what better way is there to add a layer of secure isolation against
software security vulnerabilities than to run risky software in a
virtual machine like is done with web browsers?  Really, I heard that
Android uses virtual machines already.  Okay, okay, let's take a look.

Firs of all, this is a tough subject to search for because much of the
old information is coming in at the angle of virtualizing a Raspberry
Pi on an old skool x86 PC or laptop.

Here is some info on going the other way, running x86 programs on the
Raspberry Pi.  Alas, it recommends proprietary software.  But we're
interested in native ARM virtualization.

But, we're not interested in that, we're interested in defining the
Raspberry Pi to _be_ the desktop PC itself.  So, that takes a bit more
effort to search for that subject, but with some finessing, I've found
out that there is a way.  The trick is to use OpenSUSE for Raspberry
Pi, here you will find just what you need with KVM and virt-manager.

Ah, yes, here's a more detailed walkthrough on building your own
kernel with the hypervisor enabled, and getting KVM setup.

Here is more information about setting up virtualization on Raspberry
Pi 4.  Indeed, it is possible, and in fact it can be done better and
faster than on the earlier Raspberry Pis thanks to the migration to
the more standard GICv2 interrupt controller.  However, there is still
more software configuration and setup that must be done regardless.

This VGIC emulation patch is needed only on the older Raspberry Pis.

And indeed, some of this software is still hot off the presses!  Not
too much further from the software developers from which it
originated.  There is still performance improvement to be made to the
virtual workloads versus the physical workloads.

Hooray, this is an example of an issue that has actually been fixed
with a merged pull request!  Better keep an eye on firecracker by
Amazon, looks like they're onto something with their virtualization
solution.

Now, if you really want to stretch things, then yeah you can
conceivably run Windows 98 on Raspberry Pi through CPU emulation.  For
sure it's probably fast enough for early MS-DOS, but Windows 98?  Well
I guess it's worth a try to see how much is usable.  Uses QEMU.
