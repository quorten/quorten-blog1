Code golf is a competition to reduce the size of program source code
as much as possible.

Now, this poses some interesting ideas for a bootstrap operating
system.  What if all the early bootstrap system code was written in a
code golf programming language?  That would, most importantly, reduce
the number of keystrokes for the initial type-in program, which has
obvious benefits for this particular purpose, namely reducing human
error that is proportional to the number of keys typed.

But, being that code golf programming languages are regarded as
unnecessary esoteric, I guess that would mean that I would have to
stick to the traditional ideas that I was developing for the sake of
creating a bootstrap operating system that is consistent with _modern
cultural assumptions_.

On the other hand, if the goal is to get as large of a program into as
small an amount of memory as possible, compiling code to a "code golf"
programming language, then running an interpreter on the code golf
language code could be a pretty slick way to further compress your
program code in-memory than is possible with machine-style byte code.
I'm going to have to look into that.
