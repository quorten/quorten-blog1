Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR).  This was a hard drive technology I
was really excited for because of the increased storage density, and
for photo use, high density at low cost is one of the most important
things you can ask for.  But, the crux of SMR hard disk drives, I
realized as I started using my SMR hard drive for virtualization, is
that SMR writes are slow.  And yes, this actually makes them
unsuitable for particular uses like RAID.

Therefore, there is a class-action lawsuit against Western Digital in
the making due to not properly advertising and marketing its drives
that were using SMR.
