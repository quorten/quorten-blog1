Building cheap, custom keyboards and buttons using paper, cardboard,
and aluminum foil is one sure method that works well.  But, what about
other methods for building cheap buttons?  Or, what if you have some
cheap buttons in existing consumer electronics that have started to
fail?  How do you repair those?

Now, this is where we get some more interesting ideas:

* Aluminum foil (thus mentioned)
* Pencil lead, i.e. graphite.  This is actually how some commercial
  "conductive rubber" variants are made.
* Conductive ink pen
* Conductive paint
* Aluminum foil tape
* Copper foil tape
* Gum wrappers
* Hammer copper wire flat

Finally, simply cleaning the conductive rubber pads in cheap
commercial buttons can do the trick.  But, be careful because cleaning
is also a common cause of eroding the conductive rubber pads.

This is a very good article on electronic button tech and proper
cleaning techniques.  For conductive rubber buttons, the cheapest use
only a coating on the surface that can get worn away or washed away
very easily, and therefore should be treated by addition of the
conductive coating, **not** any method of cleaning.  More expensive
conductive rubber buttons use a conductive polymer throughout such
that cleaning them is a viable option.
