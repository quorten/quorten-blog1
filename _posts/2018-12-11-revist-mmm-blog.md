So, I decided to revisit the Mr. Money Mustache blog and look for
anything interesting, and this is what I found.  Wow, quite
interesting the premises of this article.  First, an attorney writing
wanting to retire but feeling unconfident about doing so.  Then, a
story about a good friend named Luc.  Luc was someone who was arguably
less fortunate than either Mr. Money Mustache or the attorney writing
in.  Luc never had a really well paying job, instead working
blue-collar jobs to make his earnings.  But, nevertheless, through
some good decision making, he was able to reach an early retirement
and soar...  with tons of projects going on all the time.  So, the
final advice given was to just try and see what you discover.  You
might be surprised.

Wow, this is interesting.  You can build a tiny house for only $3500?
Yeah, but there are many caveats in this build, like not using a
concrete floor, and not giving a completely finished hardwood floor.

Now, these last two are really interesting.  A problem with a lot of
Americans is that they spend a lot of money on entertainment, yet this
is completely unnecessary, not to mention not as satisfying as some of
the alternatives.  Additionally, the promotional effort that goes into
pushing such entertainment offerings, i.e. first month free, is
indicative that such is not an endemically useful endeavor.  Towns
that are overrun by commercial tourism can actaully be unattractive
for touring if you like meeting the local people and learning about
culture.
