Now, this is an interesting article reflecting on the use of software
development similar to home cooking.  The specific use in this case
was to create a social media photo/video chat application for family
members of the developer's family to use.  The motivation?  They had
an existing app Tapstack that they've used for quite a while, but
Tapstack was not announcing updates or even asking long-term users to
pay for the app, it was all zero-cost use without a means for
donations.

So, naturally, this family that really liked the app needed a
replacement.  They decided to go down their own app development path
rather than using a different commercial app that would be plastered
with ads, pushing updates and changes they may not like, and carrying
the risk of shutting down.

Then the author goes on to reflect on all kinds of reasons for
home-cooking, some of which are impractical in a wholistic sense but
done for emotional reasons and the like.

But, I must interject.  Sure, it is common for home cooking to be done
for "recreational" purposes where the participants laugh in the face
of efficiency and practicality, but why do that?  Why stop there when
you can do better?  You can network into larger groups that share the
common interest and develop ways to work the solution more
efficiently.  Why stay unplugged and disconnected just for the heck of
it?
