Where do you store your photos that you use for your blog?  Well, I
don't have a complete answer to that question, but I do have a part
one answer to that question.  Suffice it to say, photography is a much
different endeavor than blogging.  Whereas the text of blogging is
typically of human authorship, the articles that you hand-craft and
shape as you please, photography is a bit different.  Photography is a
statement of how the world appeared from a particular device, at a
particular time, at a particular location.  That being said, it makes
sense to store _all_ photos under that organizational guise.

So, then, what about photos for your blog?  Naturally, those first
premises mean that blog photos should be linked from an external
source.  Diagrams, by contrast, are very dissimilar to photos and more
similar to the text of a blog in that a diagram is hand-authored by
you, and possible to reproduce by hand, just like the text of the blog
articles you type.  Photographs, by definition, are beyond human hand
reproducibility.  Where you store those photos, it's got to be on some
more general purpose photo storage server, and that is what I leave
uncovered as a part two step.

So, I guess this brings up another important point in hand.  If you
have a photo in your blog article, it better not be in any way the
sole source of some important information.  There has to also be a
simple, purely hand reproducible diagram accompanying the photo.
