First impetus for the web search.  Google Chrome thinks your web page
is in Danish?  What information does the Internet have for why this
may be the case?  Well, I didn't really find out any useful
information on that front, but I did find this StackOverflow page with
useful information on different ways of setting the language on your
page.

* HTTP Headers: Content-Language

* HTML meta: `http-equiv` `Content-Language` field, Google's preferred
  method

* HTML/XML `lang` fields
