Okay, so are there any guides on setting up a Raspberry Pi with a 5
button chorded keyboard?  Apparently not, but I've found some other
interesting things along the way.

Interesting.  "Masking tape for 3D printing."  It's just regular blue
tape, isn't it?

Wow. is that shield design 3D printed in color?  No, but it is 3D
printed in two pieces, which is interesting.

Oh yeah, and important warning.  Spray paint in a well-ventilated
place, and use a protective respirator mask to avoid breathing in
"messy chemicals."

Also, Adafruit is a good place to go to buy those buttons when you do
put them on the Raspberry Pi.
