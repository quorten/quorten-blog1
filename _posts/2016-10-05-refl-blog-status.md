I'm kind of lost.  I was going to write some additional things down,
but I don't know what.  Oh, now I know.  See below.  Anyways, what I
was going to get to first.  Wikipedia.  It has a huge amount of
information, and it is all digital, so it is very easy to download to
your computer.  The question, then, is why not?  Because you might
want to use Wikipedia to get the most up-to-date information.  I know
I sure did in order to get the most up-to-date information on My
Little Pony.

Well, anyways, JJJ TODO Get Wikipedia for Schools!  That is a good
small amount of information that is generally useful and, in a sense,
being manually reviewed, is not likely to go out of date too quickly.
Compared to other articles on the big Wikipedia.

JJJ TODO.  Hung up.  Keep the rift raft out, said Dovolis.
