Two things with COVID-19: conspiracy theories are still a problem,
why?  It's one of human ways of coping, playing the scapegoat blame
game and making up a reason that feels more controllable.

States are reopening, though that means they're loosening
restrictions, that doesn't mean it's any safer.  The hope is that
people will sufficiently self-regulate, else we'd be in for a really
big outbreak problem.

How is it like flying in the midst of this pandemic?
"Post-apocalyptic" is the word one reporter describes it with.  It
will be a long time until people can enjoy social outings like
baseball games again.  Governments can't just declare a reopening,
citizens need to see trust in other people rather than immediately
suspecting every person as a potential virus carrier.  And that's
going to take a _long time_ in this journalists' opinion based off of
his experience of flying.
