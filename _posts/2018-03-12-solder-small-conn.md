Okay, yes, so we have plenty of ideas here.  Now how to solder this
thing.  Yes, it actually is possible with your blunt tip soldering
iron, purportedly you just need practice.  Put the tip on the
connection and the wire to heat them up, and the solder on the
connection but don't let it touch the tip.  The heat will draw the
solder in and fill up the area, so I am told.  Be careful not to leave
the soldering iron on there for more than 5 seconds, otherwise you
could damage your components.  Also, make sure you are careful with
ventilation and not breathing in the fumes, and wash your hands after
soldering.  To remove solder, there are wicks you can use: put the
wick on the area you want to remove solder, and heat the wick by
putting the iron on top of it.  The wick will fill up, so you can
gently pull it across the board to sweep up more solder.

Use tape to help hold in place components with very short leads.

Fat soldering iron tip?  Don't worry.  Use a magnifying glass, or, er,
10x stereo microscope, and with practice even the tiniest of joints
can be soldered with such a fat iron.

Okay, so we also need some kind of board to practice soldering on too.
Can we make our own?  Probably, but the holes might not be as small as
you want to practice on.
