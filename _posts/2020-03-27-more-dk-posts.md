Here are some more good Digi-Key blog articles that I found.  First,
some recommendations on using low-pass filters with analog inputs for
the sake of anti-aliasing.  Of course, to some extent depending on
your particular application, this may be a judgment call depending on
whether you want to have that particular anti-aliasing effect at the
expense of lower resolution.

Second article, ways to improve the driver circuit for a piezo buzzer.
Wow, now this is interesting... so the basic driver circuits don't
give you the best output, but if you want some more "Hi-Fi" like
output, you can use some of these more complicated and expensive
driver circuits.

But, the ultra article discovery, RISC-V development boards?  Wow,
that's becoming a bigger and bigger thing so it looks.
