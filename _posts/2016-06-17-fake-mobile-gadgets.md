So what were you saying about getting a $2 MicroSD card?  Oh, yeah, I
better beware on that one.  If you're not a large OEM manufacturer,
you probably can't negotiate a deal for that low of a price.  And if
you do buy a consumer device for that low of a price, chances are you
are getting a counterfeit of despicably low quality.  Okay, okay,
fine, I guess we shouldn't go with anything less than $10 in that
case, then.  After all, the memory card is in fact one of the most
important part of the system.  You don't want to loose all your data
that you're trying to scan, do you?

Of course the manufacturers know, if someone is buying the devices in
small quantity, they're probably an engineer, so it makes sense to
charge them a little bit more than the nominal manufacturing price of
the devices in question.
