Fluoride in water?  Fluoride really helps with dentistry, we know, but
what about the criticisms of fluoride in water?  Okay, so, here's
what's going on.

Many water sources have naturally occurring minerals in them, some
more than others depending on the geography.  In earlier times, this
meant that some locales were getting too much fluoride in their
drinking water, leading to dental fluorosis.  Others were not getting
too much.  Fluoride has a protective effect on the teeth when used
properly, but generally it is not good for the body, so it seems.
Fluoride in water can absorb into the body while showering or bathing.
Nevertheless, humans were historically exposed to fluoride in small
concentrations, depending on how they sourced their water.

In modern times there are still debates about this depending on
people's municipal water supply.  Additionally, with the advent of
water filtration machines that can be purchased on the commercial
market, where the buyer tends to have far less relevant scientific
knowledge than the manufacturer, there is yet another source of
"locale" problem depending on which filtration unit someone buys,
given the variance in effectiveness in filtration units.

So, what's the difference?  Nowadays people have a "tertiary regional
source" effect that is determined by the products they buy.  These
products can improve one's conditions in areas with naturally poor
living conditions, or they can denegrade the conditions below the
natural baseline of a particular area.  The fact that nowadays,
commercial products can be manufactured and shipped to and from
_anywhere_ in the world is the reason why this is a "tertiary regional
source" effect.
