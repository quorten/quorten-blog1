Coronavirus underreporting factor of 20:1 or 50:1?  Be forewarned,
this may grow as the pandemic continues to grow across the United
States.

Also, now this is really good news.  My fear that Americans didn't
have enough sense in them to social distance to limit the spread of
the quarantine?  Thankfully, recent data shows otherwise.  As
governments lift restrictions, business activity picked up, but as
reports of infection spikes came out, consumers decided not to engage
in as much commercial activity on their own.  Yep, no need for the
government to impose the lockdown.  And that is very _good_ that the
public at large is not as intent at protesting lockdown measures as a
few extremists may have made it seem.
