Hooray!  Trisquel 9 development version is available.  This is perhaps
a great time for me to try it out, contribute to development, and
maybe also put together a digital audio workstation version like
Ubuntu Studio.

Also, please note that many artists require more up-to-date softwaer
than garden variety desktop users, so the long-term support release
cycles tend not to match very well with the needs of artists.

Sadly, I learned that Musix has been removed from the endorsed
distributions list at the request of the maintainer, due to lack of
update.  However, the maintainer is optimistic to do a solo handed
update, if only sufficient funds are donated to work one full month
without interruptions.  We'll have to wait and see.  Unfortunately, I
feel that the problem is bigger, that the community of techy musicians
has decreased in number.  Nowadays to be a musician, you no longer
need to be really skilled in tech, so I guess that's one of the big
reasons why the tech musician community is waning.

Wondering why Trisquel has its own repositories and build system,
rather than sharing that of Ubuntu?  There's a good answer and
explanation in this forum thread.
