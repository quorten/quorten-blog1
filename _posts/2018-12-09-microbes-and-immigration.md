This is interesting.  I've read about this before, but didn't take any
notes on this thus yet.  Studying digestive system microbe changes in
immigrants?  First of all, people outside the U.S. in developing and
third world countries tend to have a greater diversity in gut bacteria
than U.S. people and people of western diets.  Now, here's the
interesting part.  After immigration, after only 6 to 9 months, the
immigrant's gut bacteria changes drastically.  Most of the native
bacteria they had is lost, and they acquire the new bacteria that is
more common among western diets.  The process continues on even for 10
years.  For the children of immigrants, the shift is more drastic.
Shifting to a diet of western foods somewhat explains the change in
microbes, but it doesn't completely explain it.

Additionally, one peculiar association with studying immigrants is
that in their original conditions, obesity levels are very low, but
after migrating, obesity becomes a larger problem.  There is still a
lot unknown here, but it appears from the diagram in the article that
what happens is that in the beginning, obesity is less of a problem
for immigrants than it is for westerners, but after immigrating, it
becomes just as much of a problem for them as it is for westerners.
