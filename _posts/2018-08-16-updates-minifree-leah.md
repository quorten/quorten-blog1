So that Minifree Leah that was going to get gender reassignment
surgery?  Well, the funding goal was not reached by the deadline, but
it happened anyways.  So, the early deposit missing was what put Leah
in debt, so the fundraiser is continuing for that purpose.  Also,
after the surgery Minifree Leah is severely phyiscally impaired from
drugs, pain, and so on, for 6 to 12 months.
