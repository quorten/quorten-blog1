Once again, GitHub publishes its annual transparency report.  However,
interestingly, they note that the practice is becoming sparser as
other companies are retiring their transparency reports.  That's
unfortunate, but as the Atlantic news article says, when the interest
of the "general public" in privacy matters wanes as the news of the
Snowden leaks fades, it's pretty hard to encourage business executives
to keep at the public publications of transparency reports.

One thing I must say about the GitHub transparency report itself,
though, is that even that appears to be less detailed.
