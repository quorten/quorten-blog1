One important observation about hierarchical organization that I must
note.  Yes, it is very similar to hierarchy-free keyword grouping.
However, it's just that some search queries are more optimal than
others, and that if you want to find something exactly, you have to
specify every single keyword value in the search query, then sort them
into the proper order to get the filesystem path to the object in
question.

Oh yeah, and one important note for searching for objects by their
image.  Here's the idea.  All you need is a series of pictures to
effect a 360 degree view of the object in question.  Photos can be 2D
rotated for matching as necessary, so all you need to do is take the
2D features out of a new photograph and determine which collection of
2D photographs is best matched by this.  And, I note this one, storing
only the 3D models of the objects in question is a great way to
compress the collection of 2D photographs for the object.  However, it
does imply a cost in regenerating them, and the 2D search is a rather
different method of operation.  So, those are the caveats, and it may
make sense then to store all 2D photographs pre-rendered for
computation.  The only time it may make sense to not store them is
when you want to crunch your data down to fitting in a small storage
space.

Anyways, pretty interesting things going on here.  And especially with
hardware artificial neural networks, doing image searches by
photographing will be really fast and efficient.
