Now, this is interesting.  Here is an article on Hackaday about
getting into cars, basic maintenance.  Of course, being this is on
Hackaday, it is of course more suited to the perspective of
electronics tinkers, and that is why it's interesting.  You mean, cars
are still modern technology?  Yes... under some certain circumstances.

One thing that I would like to point out is that for many in tech,
conversion to a work-from-home job is a point of pain where they need
to have better chops on vehicle maintenance, so why not use that as an
opportunity.

And, this is an interesting story about serious engine problems that
happened due to an oil pressure shortage.  Do not let that oil
pressure run too low or let too much bad oil build up in your engine.
