Why doesn't LibreCMC use GitHub?  Because GitHub itself has its own
problems of not being libre-friendly.

So, there is an interesting alternative to use in place of GitHub.
`notabug.org` provides free hosting using the `gogs` Git server
solution.

But this is the most interesting.  Who is `gogs` developed by?  This
community that calls itself "peers" and has existed for at least since
the Dragora GNU/Linux distribution was developed.

Freedom-delayed?  Are there any projects I know in there.

Ah, yes!  There is.  ZynAddSubFx, but of course I know there is that
Yoshimi fork.  What's going on here?  For the course of modernizing
the user interface, the developer.  Come on!  What's wrong with the
existing user interface?  Yes it may look "dated" on Windows and MacOS
platforms, but I think it looks just fine on a GNU/Linux digital audio
workstation.  Sure some of the user interfaces are going to look dated
or obscure, but that is just the way things are expected to be by the
target users.

Now, this effort to turn the code proprietary for this modernization
move, for sure I think most community members will agree that is a
totally unwanted move, not to mention that the whole intent of the
project, modernizing the user interface, is unwanted by the existing
user community from the get-go.  If we want something better in that
regards, we go to Yoshimi, not one of the original developers who
wants to make it proprietary.

So where is Yoshimi on development?  Ah, development is still fairly
active.

Well, that's too bad that ZynAddSubFx has fallen down the path wrongly
taken, slipping away from the desires of the community but coming
closer to the desires of one of the individual users.  Normally this
would be considered a good thing in the libre software world, but the
fact that this single individual is intent on making money from
selling it?  Well, that's perverse considering the rejection by the
community, hence the lack of a real "customer base."
