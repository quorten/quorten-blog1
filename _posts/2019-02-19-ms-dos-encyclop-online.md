So, you're wondering.  Is the MS-DOS Encyclopedia available as an
Ebook?  Oh, now that's a trick question.  The MS-DOS Encyclopedia is
available _online_, but not as an _official_ Ebook.  There are some
plain text files corresponding to what you would have originally seen
were you to download it and read it on your own MS-DOS computer.

Interestingly, one of the early versions of the MS-DOS Encyclopedia
inadvertently revealed some Microsoft __ information, so it had to be
recalled from the shelves.  This happened even though the MS-DOS
programmers reviewed the book before publication.
