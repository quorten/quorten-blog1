Interesting, I've got note of this SE/30 forever website that contains
some information on the packaging and manuals that came with the
Macintosh SE/30 when it was new out-of-box.  However, the information
is not sufficiently rigorous to be able to manufacture a replica of
the boxing, and the manuals are missing from the website.
