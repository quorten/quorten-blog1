Now, just a heads up here.  When developing your own film, avoid using
old chemicals as you can have bad results.  Of course, this appears to
apply mostly if you use pre-mixed liquid chemicals.  But still, yeah
if you mix your own chemicals, make sure to keep the oxygen out of the
ingredient containers.
