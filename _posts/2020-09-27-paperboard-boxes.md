Okay, so I know how to make custom corrugated cardboard boxes.  Well,
that is, I know what companies to go to if I want someone else to do
the job for me.  But what about pressed cardboard, i.e. heat-pressed
fusion of multiple sheets of paper into one thick piece of cardboard?
Well, go searching around, the name proper is paperboard.  So, here
are some companies I've found that can do it.  Doesn't look as
convenient as the case for corrugated, but yeah, it's still doable.
