End of all TF (Amiga) projects because of a TF536 unauthorized clone.
Wow, this is a really interesting happenstance.

The boards got cloned following an argument in the forums.  Some other
folks thinking they've been being cheated and wanted to "teach a
lesson," so to speak.  They were otherwise scheduled to be released as
open-source February of next year, but that plan got canceled and
instead a copyright infringement lawsuit is being pursued instead.

And wow, how the community themselves comments how they sometimes try
to fight each other when they should really be trying to help each
other.
