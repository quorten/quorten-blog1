So, you're wondering about how Slack and social media software can
post article summaries when you post a link?  They use special meta
tags called "OpenGraph," popularized originated by Facebook.
Unfortunately the earlier standards of "Semantic Web" never gained as
much traction, so it seems.

Okay, let me look at my own blog for the special meta tags, and we'll
be more specific by searching for the technical jargon this time.
Success!

Now, let's see.  This Brightcove video host has trouble with having an
embedded player when posting in Slack.  How about the other Wistia
video host?  Do they have information about how they get their video
embedding to work?

On the other hand, I found an interesting article about how to look
good on a webcam.
