So, you were wondering if you can see shoe prints on hard, dry
pavement on a sunny day?  Indeed, you can.  The trick is to look for
dust or grease that is stirred up into the shoe shape.  Use
fingerprint duster and/or special lights (ultraviolet, or simply
bright LED) at an angle.

Ah, lots of great tips on SLR photography here.  This is old enough
such that film is recommended over digital cameras due to the higher
resolution of film.
