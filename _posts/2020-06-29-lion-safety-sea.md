Larger ships at sea using lithium-ion batteries?  Currently, it is not
very widespread due to different motivational emphasis between
legislation between big ships and small boats.  Small boats are
legislated more based off of environmental impact and noise
generation, so in Europe they have gone pretty much all electric.  But
big ships, those are regulated based off of safety and reliability, of
which is not well proven with lithium-ion batteries, especially for
very large battery packs.  This is a great article on lithium-ion
battery safety in that application and one system design that
optimizes such.

So, keep in mind some numbers on the thermal runaway of lithium-ion
batteries.  180 to 220 degrees Celsius for Li-NMC, 270 degrees Celsius
for LiFePO4.
