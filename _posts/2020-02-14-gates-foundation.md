The Gates Foundation.  Yeah, that place where Bill Gates is spending
all his time and money nowadays.  What is it all about?  Well, the
Wikipedia article covers a whole lot about it.  I have to say... I'm
actually not all that impressed by what they are doing.  Yeah, they
are doing some things.  But the thing about Bill Gates pulling out of
his professional software career entirely?  That doesn't seem to have
really been a good choice.  Yeah, I've heard others say things would
be better off if he kept going, and at this point in time, I have to
agree myself.  Nevertheless, when people get up to his age, many of
them retire around that point.

But, now this is the most surprising thing of all.  The Gates
Foundation is **not** meant to last forever.  Actually, many of the
agreements tie the lifespan of the foundation to the lifespan of the
founders and the major donors.  When they die, so does the Gates
Foundation die.  Why am I so shocked at this?  It's shocking because
for quite while, I thought the Gates Foundation was not merely a way
for Bill Gates to donate ot charitable causes, but also a means to
protect his assets.  Yeah, I mean sure, put most of your asset value
and net worth in the Gates Foundation, and it is protected there
because your foundation's causes are getting in good with the liberals
who will let their guard down and not tax you so heavily, right?
Yeah, indeed, that is correct.  But if you suddenly banish your asset
value from the foundation after your death, those assets are not being
protected by anyone anymore.  They just run the very high risk of
become gone, forever, likely having been spent in an imprudent manner
to empty them away as quickly as possible.
