Docker notes.  Interesting discussion about running a different
command in a Docker container.  It seems the simplest and easiest
explain way to perform this task is through `docker commit`.

Also interesting to consider Docker Compose.  Pephaps a way to run
multiple commands inside of a Docker container beyond the initial
command?
