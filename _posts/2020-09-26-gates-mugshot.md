Ha, this is interesting.  A graphics designer working at Microsoft
took the liberty to use the Bill Gates mugshot photo .

Really, is there more information online surrounding the famous Bill
Gates mugshot photo?  It sure comes up a lot of times, but the
mentions are always that the details aren't clear around the cause of
the arrest, other than it was for some minor traffic violation.  Well,
yeah, that's it.  But there are other traffic citations of Bill Gates
where the details are more clear.

So, what it seems it could be is something like this.  Well, Bill
Gates was known to be very evasive in court... he doesn't play well
with authority so some would say.  And from the later police report
that is better understood, it wouldn't be too far a stretch to say
that Bill Gates may have lashed out too much at the previous police
encounter, thus leading to his arrest.

Yeah, and apparently Bill Gates likes racing/speeding.
