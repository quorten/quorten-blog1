So, there's a video service that works well with Raspberry Pi or
something I hear of?  What was it called?

Failed search.

On, the other hand, I found an interesting article on the Raspberry Pi
VidCore APIs.  They're still by far and large proprietary: though
there's a lot of potential for them, there is very little
documentation to assist.  Much of it came from reverse engineering.
