Got some hidden Wi-fi networks from the neighbors that you think may
be causing interference to your own?  Want to find out more about
their identity?  No worries, it's actually not that hard, they still
broadcast beacon signals and you can receive them from a wireless
scan, it's just that the SSID is not filled in.

Nevertheless, if you really do want the SSID information, you can get
it.
