Trouble using a webcam on Linux with Cheese webcam booth?  Make sure
you set the resolution to something that is supported by the webcam,
i.e. its native resolution.  Then you should be able to get a picture
fine.

Try using the webcam in luvcvideeo or guvcvideo.  It will probably
work there, even if it doesn't work in Cheese.  Take note of the
resolution it operates at.
