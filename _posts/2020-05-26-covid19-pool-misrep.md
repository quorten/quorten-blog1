Pools in the summer?  How does the risk of Coronavirus change that?
This one is rather interesting.  The main risk of pools is the time
that people spend outside the water, often times socializing.  This is
where the risk fo virus transmission is the greatest.  Inside the
water, Coronavirus doesn't spread very well, it is mostly through air
how it spreads.

This is mildly unfortunate, but for my purposes, I don't see it as a
big issue.  The CDC and states have been misreporting active cases of
Coronavirus infection and past cases of Coronavirus infection in test
results of two different tests, testing for the virus versus testing
for antibodies.  But for my purposes, this doesn't seem to be a really
big issue, you can still get fairly good tracking even without full
certainty of thsoe numbers.
