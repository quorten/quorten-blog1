Firefox Quantum you're hearing about?  What is that?  It is a rewrite
of Firefox that is touted to be faster and more resource efficient.

Okay, they say that... but I doubt the resource consumption is down to
what we've observed in the earlier versions.  Modern Firefox probably
still uses a lot of resources.
