When searching for info on non-silver black and white film, I found
this instead.

20170816/DuckDuckGo black and white film non-silver

OFF-TOPIC:

20170816/https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-Hollywood-movies-rarely-have-non-white-people-Is-it-due-to-racism-or-something-else

Short answer: The sole purpose of Hollywood is to make money, and that
means targeting the demographic that has the most money.  In other
words, the primary solution to solving the demographic problem would
be to improve the representation of the minorities in the middle
class

But wait.  The first article brought up an interesting point.  There
was a "Black film renaissance" in the early 1990s, and there appears
to be one coming back in the early 2010s.  (The article was published
in 2014.)  You know what I'm wondering?  Could it be the case that
diversity in the media is directly linked to the strength of the
economy?  Well, given your logical assertions above, this would be
correct.  When the entire economy is doing better, minorities are
better represented in the media.
