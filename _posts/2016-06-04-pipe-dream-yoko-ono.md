Now, time to answer some miscellaneous questions.  Yeah, I know, this
isn't really worth anyone's time, but it is interesting that we do
have computer systems that allow us to get answers to these questions
so quickly.

What's a "pipe dream"?  It's an English language idom meaning a plan
that will likely not work.  Etymology: from hallucinations from
smoking a pipe.

Who's Yoko Ono?  Oh, some Japanese song artist, that's all.
