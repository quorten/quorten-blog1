So, revisiting the question.  Why does modern photogrammetry take so
many computational resources?

The reason why is because our present-day computer systems are
designed for mathematical and visual perfection, whereas our brain is
literally nothing but a bunch of cheap hacks on vision processing.
And that's why present-day computer vision solutions are so
computationally intensive.  It's only what's technically required to
get that kind of degree of perfection.  Human vision systems, by
contrast, get by with far less perfection.  "Perfect" images in our
mind are progressively constructed by repeated exposure to certain
objects and careful visual scanning of the object in question.  Over
time, our brain builds a more detailed image of the object in
question.  Well, some people can perform this process faster than
others.  Often times, in common language, we say these people have
"photographic memories," but in truth, they don't, strictly speaking,
because no human alive can actually see the individual "pixels" from
their retina.  The human brain only "sees" the post-processed
information that their retina passes upward, which is a description of
lines and patterns, not pixels.  That is, not unless the pixels are
large enough can the conscious brain actually see and measure in
pixels passed upward from the retina.

The fallacy of photographic memory, that's simply just not the way the
human vision system operates.

Every single pixel from that camera sensor goes straight to the CPU.
It's like a dream that humans only wish they could live, but no matter
how hard you try, your conscious brain cannot accumulate the pixel
data from multiple dark image exposures to get a bright image.  Why
not?  Because your brain doesn't see pixels, of course!

Your brain never actually gets to see the data originally captured by
your eyes.

The very expensive equipment used by astrophotographers.  Of course it
exceeds the capabilities of human vision.

Your brain's memory circuits are very much the same way too.  They
operate as fixed function structures at the subconscious level.
"Subconscious" is perhaps the word we use for all such fixed-function
structures in the human brain that operate by simple,
non-reprogrammable algorithms.  At least not in our current
understanding of computers where you can pass a program directly to a
functional unit and have that functional unit execute that program.

Though that would be pretty amazing if our brains could be fully
reprogrammable like computers.  This might be good to include in Tour
de Force of the Operation of Computers.
