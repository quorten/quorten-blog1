Okay, cool!  That means that I would need to proceed by trying to
build the... the what?  The mass scanning project?  The home inventory
system?  Oh, no, I know!  The 3D scanning file format.  3D spatial
information system, to gain _insight_ into 3D data, to visualize it.

Crazy or not?  Okay, now I found out not.  Too lazy to scan the
barcodes on objects?  Well then you can have machines scan them for
you with 3D scanning.  Just modify the algorithm to cover the surface
topology of the object, or operate across several 2D frames that give
full object coverage.

So, this is when people say that even scanning barcodes is too much.

So, not crazy.
