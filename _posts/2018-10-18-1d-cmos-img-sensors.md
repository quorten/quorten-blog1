So, now I go searching for a one-dimensional CMOS image sensor...  and
it turns out such devices are extremely hard to find.  Oh my!  I was
hoping I could use one such sensor to reduce cost on a simple
one-dimensional barcode scanner design.  Well, I guess my best bet is
to salvage the sensors from old flatbed scanners.  Finally, at the end
of some frantic searching, I've found a usable device from at at least
two manufacturers.  Yes, indeed in a forum asking why it is so hard to
find these devices on the Internet.
