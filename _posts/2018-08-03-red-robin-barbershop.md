Red Robin?  What does Wikipedia have to say about them?  Oh,
interesting.  So they were started in Seattle, Washington, then they
expanded elsewhere through franchising.  So, that would explain their
more high-tech systems in restaurant nowadays.

"Barbershop music"?  So, what is that all about?  Well, reading
carefully, apparently many barbers were historically also musicians.
So that's how they got their name.
