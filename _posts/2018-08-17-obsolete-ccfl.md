Purpose-built LED lighting fixtures have several advantages over
purpose-built fluorescent lighting fixtures for home use.

1. LED lights are less toxic than fluorescent lights: LEDs don't
   contain mercury, unlike fluorescent bulbs.

2. LED lights don't require ballasts that may make buzzing noises like
   fluorescent lights.

3. LEDs never have a flickering problem when they age, unlike
   fluorescent bulbs.

4. Expensive LEDs can produce higher quality light than fluorescent
   lights.

5. LEDs last longer and require less maintenance than fluorescent
   lights.

6. LEDs are more energy efficient than fluorescent lights.

If there are so many advantages to LED lights, are there and
disadvantages?  Yes, but the reasons are few and far between.

* High quality LED lighting can be quite expensive: the economics
  could easily work out such that a homeowner only planning to be
  resident for 5-10 years in the area would save money if they chose
  fluorescent lighting fixtures over LED lighting fixtures.

* Cheap LED lighting can be provide worse quality light than cheap
  fluorescent lighting.
