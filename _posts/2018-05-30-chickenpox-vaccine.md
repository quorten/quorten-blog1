So, this is interesting.  The chickenpox vaccine wasn't introduced
until 1995.  In Minnesota schools, a whole bunch of my peers had been
vaccinated, but I was immune from getting the real infection, in about 1997.
Why?  Well, I was in Washington state at the time, so their
health system might not have been as advanced as Minnesota's... I got
it from my older siblings who got it from school, who purportedly
would have been vaccinated by then.  Purportedly, another one of my
Minnesota peers who may have been in Washington state at the time (he
had a "Boeing" shirt) also got the real infection rather than a
vaccine.

But, the vaccination isn't 100% effective either.  One of my Minnesota
peers who have been vaccinated got infected anyways, when in 6th grade
in the year 2006.

Also, this is very interesting: humans are among the only mammals that
are naturally susceptible to the varicella (chickenpox) virus, with
only primates, chimpanzees, and gorillas observed to be susceptible to
it.

Now, this is an interesting effect of vaccination: loss of immunity in
adults in a vaccinated community increases due to being less exposed
to children who catch chickenpox.  So, this creates an interesting
situation: should adults get boosters or not?

So, this is interesting.  The vaccine was commercially available in
1984, was rolled out in Japan and Korea in 1988, and rolled out in the
U.S. in 1995.  However, vaccination is not generally practiced in
Europe.  In the UK, health service workers are vaccinated, but not the
general population.

_Where_ was it invented?

Okay, we're making progress.  The _person_ who invented it was
Michiaki Takahashi, who came from Japan.  However, they also studied
in the United States close to the time of the vaccine invention.

Wow, Wikipedia could use some improvement, but I'm not going to be the
one doing it.

Now, this is interesting.  Once upon a time, "pox parties" were used
to try to deliberately infect young children in hopes that they can
build immunity before adulthood, where the infection is much more
severe.  Nowadays these are no longer as popular due to the advent of
vaccinations, but it is still practiced by a small number of
anti-vaccinationists.  Some of them do illegal things like trying to
send purportedly contaminated items through the mail.
