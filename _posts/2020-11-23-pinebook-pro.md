Well, the EOMA 68 laptop is still waiting on production bottlenecks.
In the meantime, there is this other competitor that popped up, the
Pinebook Pro.  This is an Open Hardware laptop much more in the
conventional form factor for laptop computers.  But, the caveat?  I
really liked the approach of hte EOMA 68 of having a small, standard
"computer card" board.  It's what feels would be a most natural
extension from Raspberry Pi.  Alas, this Pinebook Pro appears not to
take that approach, instead they put the SoC straight on their own
custom printed circuit board.  So, thinking long term, the kinds of
maintenance troubles you're accustomed to with conventional laptops?
You'll get that here too.

Also, the form factor, they went with the super slim magnesium black
metal form factor that is popular nowadays.  I personally dislike it
for the implications it has on a computer board that is impossible to
repair without specialized tools.
