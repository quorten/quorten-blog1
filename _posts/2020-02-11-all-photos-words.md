Interesting article about a company that has built a data warehouse of
photos to identify anyone who has been posted their photos publicly to
the Internet.  It can then identify almost anyone, even by photos of
people decades ago.  The largest user has been police departments in
identifying criminals.  The usability of this as legal evidence in
court as been questions, and also questions of privacy issues have
been raised.

My response?  I think it's great that they're continuing to pursue the
technology in spite of obstacles.  We really do need to move forward
to a future where the common person is just as recognizable as the
most ambitious, we just need to find a good area of practice.

This is an interesting article about how every word ever spoken could
easily be stored using today's digital storage media, _without_
compression.  In the past, significant compression would have been
required to attain that number.
