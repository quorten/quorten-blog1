This is interesting, a "hot" discussion on Photography StackExchange.
Why would you carry a tripod and ND filters in 2019 when you can do
the same in software?  The answer: Well, you can't really do the same
in software, and much of the purpose of carrying a tripod is to
capture as good of an original photo as possible, which will help your
modern processing software give you even better results.  For ND
filters, well sometimes it is just easier, faster, or more enjoyable
to just use those rather than doing it all in software.  Some people
don't like the post-processing steps, they'd rather prefer a one and
done at the photography site.
