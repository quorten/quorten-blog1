Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

Powering the ODROID-C2?  Your options:

* Use a USB-to-2.5mm lead adapter with your USB power supply.

* Use a USB On-The-Go cable with your USB power supply.

* Use a dedicated 2.5mm power supply.

Yes, the community and documentation on ODROID-C2 is not as strong.
What this basically means is that you can't just hand it to a bunch of
non-technical people and expect them to get by like you would with a
Raspberry Pi for education.  However, if you are already well
accompanied with the development platform (you learned from a
Raspberry Pi Zero!), then it is definitely worth it for the
performance boost compared to Raspberry Pi 3.
