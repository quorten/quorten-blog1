Wow, very interesting introduction to modern web development for
someone from 10 years ago in 2007, to 2017.  This is what I was
looking for... sort of, but couldn't find from a web search.

Okay, point in hand here.  The article still doesn't cover enough of
the history of web development from a broad picture.

Oh, good point here!  Redefinition of the word "API."  Of course, it
didn't happen until later, when the developer community grew in
tandem.
