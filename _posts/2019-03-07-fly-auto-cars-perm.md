Well, I've read about flying cars many times before, but I thought it
would be good for me to repost these articles that I've seen on
Twitter recently about flying cars.

Oh, and about self-driving cars.  "Ask for permission rather than for
forgiveness."  People really don't like the rollout of the test
vehicles.  After they were effectively banned from California and
companies started testing in Arizona, people would sabotage and attack
the self-driving vehicles upon sight.
