Okay, there are plenty of good tools for developing camera RAWs via a
graphical user interface, but what if you need to go really fast in
developing a large number of photos with identical settings?  Like if
you are digitizing books?  No problem, there are command-line
interfaces for both RawTherapee and `darktable`.  RawTherapee's looks
to have an edge over `darktable`'s command-line interface, so that's
why it's good to install both tools for your workflow.
