Offshoring?  What does Wikipedia have to say about that?  Oh, some
interesting things.  Offshoring and outsourcing are not always the
same thing.  Wikipedia has some, well, contrived things to say on the
subject of reshoring.  3D printing has been significantly successful
in reshoring and bringing manufacturing closer to its point of
consumption.  Of course, it would not have been possible without more
advanced technology to do the work for people so that they don't have
to pay or learn how to do the work themselves.  Interestingly, once a
business has been running offshore operations for a while, reshoring
can pose a considerable challenge in the overhead of changing all the
business processes that have been set up for.
