What is this?  What is this?!!  My text data in the computer was never
supposed to get this big.  _Megabytes._  Okay, fine.  I guess I had it
coming for me if I know there are other people who have megabytes of
text data inside the computer.

And, I guess in another sense, let that be a lesson to me.  Let that
be a lesson to me in second thinking that all the text data I would
ever need, or even more so, that I would ever type out of my own
fingers, would be smaller than some certain size.  Because, as you can
clearly see from this particular example, that is clearly not the
case.  And, it still doesn't take into consideration, the fact that
speech comes at a much higher rate and at a much greater frequency
than text data.  So this is only the tip of the iceberg in the
severity of data.  With an avalanche more of data to come once I turn
on speech-to-text technologies.

So how do you do speech to text locally?

Search for "Asia_Online" above to find my related notes for running a
local language translation service.  Wow, so you're saying you can run
speech-to-text, language translation, and text-to-speech all locally?
Yes, you _can_, but do you _want_ to?  It's definitely not practical
for the small amount of memory and computation that most mobile
devices have.  That's why, as it turns out, that for mobile devices
that claim to provide these services, many could just as well be
running the actual translation within the cloud, and all the device
does is capture and upload the data.
