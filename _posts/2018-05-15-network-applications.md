As I've noted earlier, only a subset of software has become immensely
popular in modern computing; namely, the software required to connect
to the Internet.

As much as I like having a diverse array of local software with useful
features and functions, I need to get this fact straight with myself.
Ultimately, all such software is _specialist_ or _toy_ software
compared to the body of software and equipment for connecting to the
Internet and browsing the Internet.  The user community for merely
connecting to the Internet and doing the rest of work from there it is
huge, such that their needs would surely trump those of the specialist
users if you had to make a decision to provision a computer system
limited resources available, yet for a large number of users.

Now, how does AI relate to this picture?  Don't you want to have a
local AI on your system too?  _Only if it has a web API for your
browser._  Otherwise, it might as well be done over the Internet as an
application on a remote computer.
