Born digital?  It is very weird when you think about it.  What is it,
exactly?  All works of artificial human authorship that can be entered
directly into a computer device of some sort.  If, however, it cannot
be "directly entered," it cannot be considered "born digital."  Now
this can get quite tricky.  Photographs can be "born digital," but
this does not extend to the objects that have been photographed.

Interesting article/viewpoint here.  "Digital surrogate" is the term
used for scanned copies here.

* Footnote: But the point in hand.  Manufacturing only happens to a
  specific tolerance, and once that tolerance is reached, the
  manufactured object is deemed merchantable.  For aged objects, you
  can also artificially accelerate aging of an object based off of its
  use characteristics.

  So, the point about a digital surrogate not being able to fully
  replace an original artifact?  Not true.  I would say that yes, in a
  minority "professional historian" profession it is, but not true in
  general if you look at the full industry.

  Suffice it to say, the only extended information about an original
  object not within a digital copy would be those details that
  normally wouldn't be manufactured: wear and tear from use, traces
  about the age of an object, etc.

Yeah, but at the end of the day, I really do have to admit:
professional archivists are in some sense an illegitimate, or shady
and underhanded, profession.  They are not archivists in the pure and
unbiased sense, they do have an obvious slant toward commercial gain.
In the end, the professional archivist working for the non-profit is
not much different than the professional archivist working for the
for-profit.  Hobbyist archivists are a little less biased, but even
they are biased.  Aggregating multiple hobbyist archivists is still
less biased, but still even then you are left with a distinct bias of
human nature.
