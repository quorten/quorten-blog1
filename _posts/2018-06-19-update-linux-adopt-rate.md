Linux adoption.  For sure, this has been a steadily growing area,
whereas Windows adoption has been steadily declining.  For sure, much
of the growth has come from Android smartphones and Chromebook
netbooks, both namesakes of Google.  Previously, Google had a very
hard time encouraging more end users to run GNU/Linux, so they focused
primarily on running it on their own servers.
