I'm still determined.  Looking for the ideal solution for Wi-Fi
indoors, when you need to build smaller cell sizes than traditionally
is the case.

Bingo!  I found this really great article, in research paper format,
from Cisco on engineering wireless networking for densely populated
spaces like auditorium halls.

Alas, many of the numbers on the space recommendations do indeed
assume larger interior spaces.  For example, some of the smallest
coverage numbers are larger than some houses.  Nevertheless, the
directional antenna recommendations are useful when you _only_ want to
cover a small space.

So, I didn't quite find what I was originally looking for, but I got
pretty close.  That's simply because, as I noted, the "small" cell
sizes still weren't small enough.
