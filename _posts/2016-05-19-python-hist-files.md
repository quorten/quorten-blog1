How annoying is it that there is a `~/.python_history` file written by
Python 3?  This was never the case for Python 2.  Well, anyways, be
glad that I told you that, so that you can be on the lookout for times
where you might type in some testing code at the interactive debugging
prompt, to find out that your secret tokens have been logged to a file
that they weren't supposed to go to.
