Surely, there's got to be more and better ways to raise sinking
foundations.  Concrete jacking, well I don't like that because you're
kind of ruining the soil beneath the house, and if that soil was high
quality agricultural soil, it probably still is and you might as well
want to leave it as is!  So, indeed, there is a better solution.
Hydraulic jacking with steel piers is indeed viable for houses, not
just larger office buildings.  This way, you don't need to mess up the
soil by pumping concrete into it.

Of course, absolutely make sure your water drainage setup is the best
it can be.
