First of all, during early discussion at the GoMN Meetup, someone
presented a link to a COVID-19 chart website that they really liked,
mainly because it shows the data adjusted for the population and you
can overlay the data for multiple states together.

Now, for the presentation name and title info, dependency injection as
a means of software test.  Make it real easy and elegant in Golang.
