Youtube TV may help, since it's subscription based.

In the past year, they've come out with Youtube Premium/Red, Youtube
TV and have "Super Chats" on live streams where they take 50% of all
donations. So they are definitely trying to address the issue.

So what about Google Drive and Gmail?  Surely their loosing money in a
similar way.  Okay, maybe Gmail is profitable, but Google Drive
certainly was not, which is why their decreasing their free data
limits and making more people pay.

But this.  Dang.  About tech giants subsidizing unprofitable products.
The Amazon Echo One is built around much more expensive design and
Manufacturing than the Sonos speaker, and it sells for a lower price?
Also, Amazon has a lot of unfair advantages here: the own the Alexa
platform, and they own the online store that sells it such that they
don't need to pay any retail markup.  Oh, **and** they own the
advertising and marketing channels for their product.
