Are you trying to build up flip-flops and counter circuits from the
very basic building blocks?  Wikipedia has some excellent information
on the subject.  Read it carefully, think on your own for a little bit
more knowledge, and you should be in business.

Please note that the old version of this Wikipedia article linked has
a JK flip-flop schematic.  It unfortunately got removed from the
latest version.
