* New summary of why you should not make your hobby projects
  proprietary in order to get money.  Answering the question of why
  someone should not expect to get rich off of fiction writing, for
  example.

* First of all, if you want to make money, you should find career
  skills that are wanted by the economy, not work the other way around
  and try to make people want to pay for your interest.

    * Your interest might be over-specialized and in general not
      wanted by the economy, so unless you can prove yourself an
      exception, namely in having the right political connections, you
      probably don't have a chance in such a limited economy.
      Technical skill is a lesser contributing factor in helping you
      get your way into over-specialized professions.

* Second, the greatest factor in determining the success of media is
  its marketing and promotion.  Often times this hinges around having
  connections to the right people, not the content's quality itself.

    * Can you provide me with some examples?  I want to see this
      proven in practice!  Yes, yes, that's what the scanning project
      is all about.  Examples of high-quality technical art content
      practice outside the context of marketing coverage.

    * Also, remember that although old forms of marketing and
      promotion have evolved to have an incumbent political status,
      new forms greatly hinge around new technologies.  Internet
      search engines known to the mass market have changed the world
      in terms of marketing, for example.

* Third, if you attempt to restrict the distribution of your work
  without any marketing promotion to help guarantee its distribution,
  changes are you will not make any money and nobody will see your
  work.

* Forth, when you restrict distribution and nobody ends up seeing it,
  there is lack of community.  That alone is a strong driving force in
  making people want to stop doing something or leave.

* Fifth, lawyers.

    * Lawyers are not economic either.  They don't make economic
      sense.  You'll likely loose more money over lawyers then you
      gain.  Do you really want to invoke this?

        * Legal involvement was designed for a more expensive and more
          limited economy of the past.  Nowadays, for most
          professions, it is considerably cheaper to recreate a
          compatible clone using the technical skills people than it
          is to negotiate out a specific copy of proprietary media.

    * Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  What is the
      license or legal text all about?  Basically, to summarize its
      purpose above anything else, it is "am I threatening to sue you
      if you violate these terms?".  If the answer is "no," then it is
      not a "license" or contract and does not have a legal
      interpretation.  Meaning, it will not invoke lawyers to litigate
      on the issue.

      That being said, almost no practical use of information requires
      the invocation of a lawyer, so it is more often a practical idea
      to disclaim all legalese involvement and resort to permissive
      requests.  Meaning, if people violate such asks, you may have a
      word with them for their violations, but you will not threaten
      to sue them or cause any other damages to them.

* Conclusion.  Not only is it not economic, it also creates a lack of
  community, and that is a very convincing deterrent for most people
  to quit economic sectors that are abandoned.
