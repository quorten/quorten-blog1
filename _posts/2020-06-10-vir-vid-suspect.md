Wow, this is what it is like to be incorrectly identified as a suspect
in a viral video.  It is very taxing and stressing on the target,
especially when the target was totally unaware of the circulation of
the viral video.  It started out from a police report error in the
date that the crime happened.  Alas, once the mob finds a victim, it
is quick to respond with harshness and slow to catch up with
corrections in factual errors.

This is the actual person who was harassing the other folks in the
video, now arrested and charged.
