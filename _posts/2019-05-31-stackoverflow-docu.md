So, in the middle of a web search for other things, I found some
interesting things about StackOverflow.  First of all, StackOverflow
has a "meta" website where there are questions and answers about the
StackOverflow service itself.  Second, StackOverflow once tried to
roll out a "StackOverflow Documentation" system, in an effort to
improve the state of documentation available, but in the end they had
to sunset it.  Why?  The main reasons were that one of the motivations
for developing the system was that it would help bring in more revenue
to StackOverflow, when more people would use it because of the greater
service offerings.  It didn't.  As it turns out, documentation is a
tough place to make improvements in, and although there are
improvements to be made, the fact is, with documentation, there is
already a lot of good or at least passible stuff out there already.
What really got StackOverflow started was the fact that before
StackOverflow, there was basically nothing else out there on the
Internet, at least nothing that was publicly available, so
StackOverflow was really a "killer app" in its category.

Also, I found this other interesting and related article about how
StackOverflow makes money.  Basically, they concentrate on
StackOverflow careers as their way to make money through advertising.
From a community and logical standpoint, the concept is very
legitimate.
