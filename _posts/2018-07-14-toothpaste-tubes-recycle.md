Important!

Can you recycle toothpaste tubes?  Yes, but toothpaste tubes and
toothbrushes require special recycling separate from your typical
aggregate recycling bin.  Likely you will do a mail-in recycle to
TerraCycle.

Toothpaste tubes can be Aluminum Barrier Laminate (ABL) Tubes, which
are multilayer composite materials and thus more difficult to recycle.

Other interesting notes on recycling.  Don't recycle napkins, paper
towels, and tissues, even if they are not soiled, as the shorter fiber
lengths makes them less likely to recyclers and can still result in
quality contamination in the recycling process because of this.
Likewise, fast food bags made out of 100% recycled material are less
valuable for this purpose too.
