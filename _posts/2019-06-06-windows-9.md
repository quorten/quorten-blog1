Windows 9?  What does a web serach have to say about that?  Oh, there
are a few interesting things.  Indeed, skipping Windows 9 and going to
Windows 10 was a nod toward the fact that Microsoft was really trying
to turn away from the terribleness of Windows 8, similar to what
Windows 7 did to Windows Vista.

Also, there is this other interesting article about the user
interface, and some questions on innovation, short term versus long
term gain.
