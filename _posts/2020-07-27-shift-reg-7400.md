Looking for more guidance on perfboard assembly?  Take a look at this
project that shows a deep dive into building a logic circuit on
perfboard.  Yes, looking at the solder joints, there's lots of
imperfection, and finally when it comes to breaking out the final I/O
connectors to your embedded computer, you have a "beanstalk" of
vertical wires sprouting up in random places.  However, unlike on my
project, this developer did **not** use crimp-on connectors to provide
a more clean break-out of the available signals.  Oh, and yes, the
developer also used a whole bunch of white wires rather than using
colored wires throughout the entire assembly, though there were some
colored wires.  And, yes, when wires needed to be routed back to the
perfboard, overlong wires were indeed used to make grabbing easier.
