North American power plugs known as NEMA connectors.  Interesting
about new safety regulations, tamper-resistant plugs that use a
spring-loaded shutter disconnecting the terminals.  Arc fault
protection that is more nuanced than circuit breaking only on current,
if there is a leak through a frayed power cord for example.  And leak
current detection power cords that can detect if current is leaking
through a frayed power cord, thus preventing a fire by that means.
