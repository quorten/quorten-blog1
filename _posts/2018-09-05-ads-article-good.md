Important!  First I start with a wild web search:

Then I find a really great article about ads, from `lifehacker.com`.

How Advertising Manipulates Your Choices and Spending Habits (and What
to Do About It)

Well, it's more about the effect that ads have on people, and the
problems that ads can introduce into people's lives.  Wow, indeed I
must agree, this article is very insightful and genuine.

I must emphasize this point.  That article is a very excellent and
well written article.  The first time through trying to take notes on
it, I was quoting so many long text sections that I had to reconsider
my approach and just direct the reader to go read that article in
full, with a hearty encouragement like this one.  Yes, it's really
that great.

In spite of that, let's try to summarize some of the most important
key points presented here.

* "The Problem: Advertising Is for the Rich, Not You."  Many ads
  advertise nice-to-haves that are not life essentials, but the whole
  concept of actually purchasing the item advertised is beyond the
  means of the middle class.

* The primary purposes of ads are to tell you about a product and to
  arbitrarily justify it.  Often times an emotional justification is
  used for maximum deception.

* Only you can logically determine if a product is right for you, not
  the ads.

* The lack of adequate logical determination and the impulse of
  advertising has taken its toll on some people.  The advertising
  influences are multi-faceted.

  > Take the show Friends, for example. Rachel and Monica shared a
  > gigantic apartment in Manhattan despite Rachel working, for some
  > time, as a waitress and Monica as a chef. Collectively they
  > enjoyed a lifestyle they couldn't afford. This is one example of

  > a better lifestyle than they can afford without many monetary
  > concerns. And then we're shown advertisements, compelling us to
  > buy the lifestyle depicted in our favorite shows.

  The combined results on the middle class, i.e. the quantitative
  statistics on lifestyle that really matter?  Those who succumb to
  marketing messages find themselves in heavy credit card debt that is
  tough to pay out of.  The penultimate conclusion of this are
  advertisements on services to escape credit card debt.  Where do you
  think this is going to end?

* The real solution.  Start making lifestyle changes.

* First, become more skilled at identifying marketing messages, then
  look critically for the logic, or lack thereof.  Don't be fooled by
  the emotional deception.

* Second, if that is not working for you well enough, take steps to
  avoid ads.  Now, this is where things get really interesting.

    * "If you want to cut out ads from television and never, ever see
      them, your options aren't necessarily great."

    * "You can buy DVDs when they come out several months after the
      television season has ended"You can buy DVDs when they come out
      several months after the television season has ended

    * "You can purchase content at a premium (either online or on
      demand through your cable provider)"

    * "You can download content via the internet (which may require a
      set of flexible ethics)"

    * "You can't remove or block ads in a magazine or newspaper, so
      you'll have to start reading online and use an ad blocker."

    * "Even with all of that, you still can't avoid billboard ads or
      ads you see outside of your personally cultivated ad-free zone.
      You're also not without the influence of reference lifestyles
      (as discussed earlier) unless you cut out entertainment media
      altogether."

* Ultimately, you can't avoid all ads, especially those that have
  already been experienced and are in latent memory, so you're going
  to need to focus on getting good at staying logical even in light of
  marketing messages.

* Implementing "a mandatory holding pattern" on your purchases, where
  you write down a product that you want and don't purchase it until a
  few days later, is a great approach to tackling the problem of
  impulsive purchasing that advertisers work so hard to persuade.

----------

Ultimately, there's a much bigger question at work here, though.
Suppose you are running a business of your own and you want to run
some advertisements, literally for the sake of telling people about
your product.  Also, suppose you have a really strong belief in
honesty and integrity when running your business.  How do you go about
doing it?  Now, here's my attempt to define an ethical advertising
model.

* Focus on your primary goal.  Your primary goal is to tell other
  people about your product.

* Do **not** use an arbitrary justification for why people should buy
  your product.  Especially, avoid deceptive justifications that hinge
  off of emotions.

* Focus on describing your product for its own merits.  Do not use
  superficial claims of how your product compares to the competition.

* Do not try to convince the viewer that your product is a must-have.
  That is a decision that only they can make.  It could be a mighty
  well idea to emphasize this point in your own advertisement.

* Do not target your ads in media where the viewer is most
  "vulnerable": newspapers, magazines, television, and so on.  Try to
  get your ads placed where you know your users will have full logical
  thinking on them.

* You probably don't want to run your ads in any "sideline" for that
  reason.  Try to focus more on getting your ads inside the focus
  content of whatever media you pick.  If your target is a directory,
  get a directory entry for your business and get it sorted out into
  the proper categories.

  In practice, this "sideline" rule means that you won't be able to
  use many sources of ads.
