Take this?  Raspberry Pi Zero?  Well, actually, not quite.  It really
depends on what you want to do with your computer.  If you need all
those manufactured fancies of modern computers, sure, go with the
upgraded models.  But, if all you need is the pins on the edge to wire
up to other things, a Raspberry Pi Zero will save you money.
