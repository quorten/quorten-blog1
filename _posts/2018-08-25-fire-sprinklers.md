Fire sprinklers you ask?  For what kinds of buildings does code
mandate them for?  Generally, you can say that fire sprinklers are not
mandated for buildings, but the kinds of buildings they appear in are
generally factories, office buildings,

Interestingly, fire sprinklers were around for a long time, since the
early 1800s, but a long-standing problem in adoption was their cost.
So, the way to get adoption moving forward among customers was to work
with insurance companies to have the fire sprinkler system installed
in exchange for a reduction in insurance premiums.
