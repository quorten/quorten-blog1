So I've been writing some simple toy electronic banking software and
wanted to see how the auto-pay accounts looked in the far future, so I
jumped the clock.  Alas, I found my software was vulnerable to the
Y2K38 bug!  So I looked around and tried to set up all the magic to
get 64-bit time, but it still didn't work.  So now I went a-searching
the Internet, and sure enough, I unfortunately found out that this is
an issue with Linus Torvald's attitude on the issue.  32-bit Linux
will not have 64-bit time system calls available.  Alas, being that my
old Raspberry Pi is only 32-bit, this means that I am pretty much
stuck with this problem if I keep using the conventional standard C
library functions in my software.

Looks like perhaps the best solution is to switch to my own
lightweight standard C library.
