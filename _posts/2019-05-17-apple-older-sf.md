Apple "Older Software" page... ah yes, I have previous references
where I simply mention that by name, but that was nearly 10 years ago
by now.  Surely, a commercial company like Apple could not be that
reliable with supporting their older technology, now could they?
Indeed, they are not.  The original page is off the face of the
Internet.  Luckily, a quick web search does yield live archived copies
on other sites.

The Gryphel Project also has some saved copies, but not nearly as
many, and it does mention the original URL.  You can find the archived
page in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.
