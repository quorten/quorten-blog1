Here is another article on the history of Unix, this time from Ars
Technica.  One interesting point that I wanted to call out from a mere
skim of its contents, it mentions that the famous photo of Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs wasn't published in
Scientific American until Ritchie's hair was less luxuriant and
lighter, and the captions were reversed.
