Okay, so when searching for information on telephone jacks, I learned
some interesting things to take note of.

* "Registered jacks" are very specific to the implementation
  of an installed jack use.

* RJ45 is technically an incorrect label for Ethernet jacks because
  Ethernet jacks are unkeyed 8P8C connectors.

* If you care mainly about the mechanical and electrical
  specifications of the plug, then the 6P6C, 6P4C, 6P2C, etc. names
  are the correct ones to be searching for.  Nevertheless, given the
  frequent incorrect usage that has emerged in relation to Ethernet
  connectors, you might as well also try searching for the RJ jack
  colloquialisms.

* PBX = Private Branch Exchange, which refers to a telephone switching
  system installed in a business.  Nowadays with VoIP, a PBX is easy
  for anyone to setup.
