I've been working in the tools group of a company for a little while,
and we have a shared repository space called a "project" where we
place repositories repositoies.  Many times when working on active
initiatives, it has been an annoyance among several team members that
there are so many repositories in the shared space.  So, I look around
in a little more detail, and pretty soon, I found that there were
several unmaintained repos cluttering the list of repos in the
project.  Nearly 50% of all the project repos are now unmaintained.
This happened in about 4 years time for most of them, some of them 7
years time.

Reflecting on this, it really makes you think.  First of all, this is
biased toward small respositories.  But, even them, in 4 years time,
50% of small-time projects will have been replaced?  Also, this
appears to be affected by the employment turnover rate in different
areas of the company.  In the areas of the company outside the United
States where the turnover rates are higher, there appears to be a much
bigger swath of abandoned projects than in the United States where the
turnover rate is lower.
