Disk Copy 4.2... ah yes, the venerable Macintosh floppy disk copying
software.  What if you can't run it since you are operating on a
different operating system, but you want to get at the data contained?
Or what if you are writing your own disk copy software and you also
want to be able to write out data in that file format?  No problem,
I've found some pretty great references on the Disk Copy 4.2 file
format right here.

Also, good news, for I had not been fully aware of this, but Mini vMac
also supports direct emulation on the Disk Copy 4.2 file format.  The
main benefit of this, beyond convenience, is that the Disk Copy 4.2
file format has provisions for storing file tags, so you get a more
accurate emulation of Macintosh floppy disks in that respect.
