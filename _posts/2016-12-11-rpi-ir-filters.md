National Camera Exchange is a good place nearby (in Golden Valley,
Minnesota) to consider to go for buying camera equipment such as
filters.

Possible filters to consider.  On from Schott, one from Hoya.

This is a very useful information page on optical filters.  I should
read up more on it in detail.

Ah ha!  Here's a filter that seems to do the job.  Now that I know
what search terms to use.

* IR cut filter
* IR pass filter

$15. 15 x 15 mm is what we are considering for our Raspberry Pi camera
filters.
