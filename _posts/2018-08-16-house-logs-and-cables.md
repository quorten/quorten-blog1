Lessons learned from the house logs.  Humans naturally have a quite
poor sense of time.  Humans can remember the details of what they did
just fine, but remembering the time, that is a bit harder.  Also, I
must note, some animals such as mice and rats do indeed have a better
sense of time than humans.  For huamns, sure, it is the industrial
revolution that largely improved human sense of time throughout the
day, and computers, well, of course the modern machines have no
problem with sense of time.

The common human colloquialism for being bad at judging time: saying
"it seems like it happened just tomorrow" when in fact something
happened over 20 years ago.

Wondering how you can detect information about the shape and geometry
of pre-installed cables or cable paths?  One idea: Use high-frequency
signal reflection in a wire to measure its length.  With very precise
signal return timing, you can calculate the length of wire until the
termination point.  Measuring the path of the wire is, of course, much
trickier.  However, with high frequency signals, you can measure radio
frequency emission strength at various points throughout the room to
determine what zones are closer and further from the actual cable
path, so long as the wire is not cased in conduit.
