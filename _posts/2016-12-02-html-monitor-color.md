I was adjusting the light intensity and color temperature of some
monitors on a computer to match the color temperature and light
intensity of a surrounding room.  However, these monitors were
connected to a Mac computer that was not my own, containing only
"basic" software on them as of 2016.  So, how.  A basic painting
program would normally be my first go-to place for displaying a color
on the monitors.  But, considering there was no basic painting program
on this computer because it was a Mac, my next go-to would naturally
be the web browser.  Every computer in today's modern world must have
a web browser, so I can simply display a color on the monitor by
writing a very simple web page.  So, this is what I wrote.

`color.html`:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Color</title>
</head>
<body style="background-color:#ffe0a0">
</body>
</html>
```
