So, yeah, I have the miniature libc implementation I wrote for my
`example2` calculator program, but surely, someone else must have
written other miniature libc implementations.  So, I go a-searching,
and this is what I find.

Honestly, I have to say that for what I found so far, I am not
particularly impressed with.  I think my idea of taking a
well-established, full-featured but still lightweight standard C
library, but adding in more modularization, and really fancying up the
documentation about the internals, that's the way to go.
