ESP8266?  Yes, I've read about that chip many times, but up to this
point in time I haven't taken notes and references for information on
the chip.  In brief, I'll explain the chip as follows.  The ESP8266
and related chips are a very popular alternative for small embedded
microcontroller applications where you might otherwise use an Arduino.
However, unlike an Arduino, it has Wi-Fi built-in, it is very small,
it has few external interface pins, and in theory it would be very
cheap if mass produced.  There is a newer version of the chip named
ESP32.

My main reason why I do not like the chip?  Well, like I may have
pointed out, some of the claims of the chip like its cost isn't really
a reliable one to hinge off of for hobbyist use.  Also, for hobbyist
use, I'm not sure you could really say this is a good standard chip if
it started out with poor documentation, and the specifics by which it
became popular may point to it being a fleeting fad rather than
something that's going to be here to stay for quite some time like the
Raspberry Pi.  So, my preference would be to avoid it for my own
electronics projects.  For now, at least.
