Electronic homework assignments, often times proprietary software
curriculums from companies of the like of Pearson Education and McGraw
Hill.  What does Wikipedia have to say about this?  Interesting.  So,
Pearson is British headquartered, not United States headquartered.
And indeed, to confirm your assumption, yes they are the biggest
commercial education materials company, bigger than McGraw Hill.
Also, nowadays Pearson owns a whole lot of publishing companies that
were once separate companies, such as Addison-Wesley, Prentice Hall,
etc.

So, after this reading, the most interesting thing I learned?  Testing
is apparently a "huge corporate profit-centre."  So, if you have
questions about why testing is so prominent in school days, follow the
money trail.
