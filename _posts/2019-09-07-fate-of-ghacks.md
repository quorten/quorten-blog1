When searching for other subjects, I came across this page by
accident, and it sure is interesting.  gHacks, a once strong and
mighty website, got hit really hard by some changes that Google made.
Pretty soon, they were slipping from the page rankings, they were
getting less traffic, ads were bringing less revenue, and it all over
became difficult to keep things running.  No longer could they have
paid writers, or definitely not nearly as many of them.  All of this,
hinging around the random popularity trends that the Google search
engine brought.  Except for the fact that the Google search engine
itself remained popular nonetheless, and some of the big and
monopolous sites became ever more popular.
