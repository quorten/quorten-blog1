Random notes.

So you're wondering about Lowe's?  Home Depot is the most popular,
Lowe's second, and Menards third (as of 2018).  Also noteworthy is
their participation in NASCAR sponsorship.

Now if you're wondering about Hendrick Motorsports and the like, they
are stock car racing teams that basically manage many of the technical
aspects of building and maintaining the cars.
