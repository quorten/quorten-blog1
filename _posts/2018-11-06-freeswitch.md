FreeSWITCH?  So, I've heard that one of my coworkers was using
FreeSWITCH at a previous company for the sake of their customers to
access telephony over the Internet.  Interestingly, I found FreeSWITCH
on Wikipedia, and its initial release date is apparently before
FreeSWITCH was first released.  Could it be that the company he was
working for developed it internally, and later released it as
open-source software?

Anyways, interesting telephony software if you want to setup your own
VoIP services or the like.
