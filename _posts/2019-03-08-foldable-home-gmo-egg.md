Very interesting.  Foldable smartphones are here.  Bendable screen
devices are coming.  At the end of the day, I must say this is more
about novelty than about practical functionality.  A foldable screen
smartphone honestly isn't that much different than, say, a Nintendo DS
with two folding panels that contain separate, non-foldable screens.

Chicken eggs?  A genetic modification could ease testing for
male/female among egg laying breeds.  Currently, the fastest, easiest,
and cheapest method is to check after hatching and send the males off
to meat grinders.

Now, this is the article I've been waiting to read.  Smart homes are
being forced upon apartment tenants, and they are not liking the new
worries of the invasion of privacy and potential data sell-offs to
advertisers.  Indeed, it is really happening today!  In California, of
course.  Other places of the United States are not nearly as overly
eager to jump forward to the future before the technology is well
developed.

For modern style smart gadgets, stories abound of hacking the devices,
many due to compromised passwords.  Now, that's something that you
don't get happening with the more traditional means of firmware
engineering.
