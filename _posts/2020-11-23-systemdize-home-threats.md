Oh no!  Lennart Poettering wants to systemd-ize the Unix home
directory system?  Not only is this unnecessary, it's going to end
poorly by making Unix home directories unnecessarily tedious for
little people, while the big institutions are going to just keep using
`nsswitch` to apply their own personal favorite of SSS (only used by
Red Hat), LDAP (used by almost everyone), vas3 (used only by a few
obscure large institutions), and others.
