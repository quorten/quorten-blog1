Wow, this is great.  After visiting this site, I saw that QEMU now
supports Mac OS 9 PPC system emulation!  That means I don't have to
juggle around another bespoke emulator system when emulating Mac OS 9.
Old PCs and old Macs, they can both come from QEMU, along with modern
virtualization from KVM.  Super-slick.
