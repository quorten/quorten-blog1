So, I was thinking about swamps and humans' relationships with them,
and I realized something interesting.  In earlier times in Europe,
there was quite a bit of wetland, swamp land included.  The swamps and
wetlands were a subject of much folklore, cultural works, paintings,
and so on.  Many artists and scientists liked to venture out into the
wetlands for creative inspiration or scientific study.  But, the
people's appreciation of the wetlands stops here.  The wetlands
harbored organisms that caused hazards and diseases to humans.  The
wetlands could not be farmed efficiently.  You could not build a house
or an office on the wetlands.  Owners of wetlands were appraised with
lower real estate property values than non-wetland owners.  In
summary, human society around the area thought of the wetlands mainly
as a giant playground, but ultimately they had no practical business
use.  In light of economic pressures, or the sheer desire to make more
money for oneself, many people drained the wetlands to increase the
real estate property value, decrease their insurance rates, and in
general improve the economy as they saw it.  That's how we got to the
wetland barren world that we live in today.

The wetlands were an example of an "ugly place."  Despite this fact,
they were a wildly popular subject to paint.  The same phenomenon can
be observed in photography.  Does a building look ugly or junky?  All
the better for photography.  Now, as we have learned, this is where
things can get dicey.  The creative photographer loves to photograph
run-down buildings, but the owner of the building in question is
rarely as enthusiastic.  So, yeah, this is one very important
difference between between photographing the natural world versus
photographing the artificial world.  But, when legal considerations
are permitting, there really isn't much that would be considered
"ugly" from the eyes of a creative photographer.
