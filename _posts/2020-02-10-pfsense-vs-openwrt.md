So, what's the difference between pfsense and OpenWRT?  Well, a
cursory web search seems to point to this: pfsense was originally
designed for full-blown x86 hardware, so it has many more features
because the hardware is much more powerful, but OpenWRT originally
targeted mainly small embedded routers.  So, there you have it.  If
you want to go big, go with `pfsense`.  If you want to stay
"relatively" small, stick with OpenWRT... though the growing bloat of
the Linux kernel used in OpenWRT is pretty much leveling out the
differences.

So, if you think the baseline Linux kernel has grown hopelessly
bloated.  then you might as well just switch to `pfsense`.  On the
other hand, maybe you think the meager attempt at simplicity will
result in a more secure system nonetheless, so you could stick with
OpenWRT on that argument.
