Want to put a MC68000 on an FPGA?  No worries, this is easy!
OpenCores has already implemented this, look here!

The license is GNU Lesser General Public License version 3, so if you
have some Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 code, like from
Steve Chamberlin's FPGA IWM, then you can combine the whole product
together under the license GNU General Public License version 3.
Yeah, I know, it's tricky, but at least it works.  Yeah, and if you're
wondering about, Steve Chamberlin also implemented a Macintosh Plus
clone on an FPGA, this involved writing FPGA cores for the support
chips like the VIA.  But, what license is that under?  Since the TG68
core is under LGPLv3, this means the remainder of the whole linkage
can potentially be proprietary.  And since the license for the
remainder is unspecified, we might as well just assume the remainder
of the code is proprietary, given what we know about Steve Chamberlin.

So, a problem I'm seeing stir up here... TG68 is written in VHDL, but
some of my code is written in Verilog?  How do you put the two
together onto a single FPGA?  No worries, you can instantiate Verilog
from within VHDL.  So, your master module that includes all the code
of the FPGA will be written in VHDL, and your submodules can be in
Verilog.  Well, that being said, my understanding of the big thing to
know about the two languages is that Verilog is simpler and more
universal, whereas VHDL is more powerful.  But, point in hand, Verilog
is also more popular for relatively simple logic designs.

One more thing, wondering how the high-speed timing on the Macintosh
Plus and earlier work?  The whole thing about shifting the phase of
the high-speed timing, and READ PHASE, that is tricky.  Well, shifting
the phase is well-documented, but the READ PHASE portion?  That I do
not know about.  But, this was a design made by Burrell using minimal
logic from PAL chips, so it totally makes sense that he would prefer a
software solution for the synchronization.  Here is some great info
about this.
