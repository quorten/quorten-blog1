FPGA development has long been much more difficult than
microcontroller and GAL development due to the lack of open-source
tooling.  In recent years, some open-source programming tools have
been developed for Lattice.  So, how are the supported platforms going
today?  Very much it's still just Lattice, though word is out about a
Xilinx reverse engineering effort that is getting further along.
