Okay, so I'm wondering.  How does the Pentax K-1 do with infrared
photography?

After some searching, it looks like what you need to do is get the
camera converted.  So, the infrared filter is included in the camera
by default.

Is the Pentax K-1 really mirrorless?  I thought it had a pentaprism
viewfinder with flip-up mirror?  It does.  So, that must be an error
on the side of the third-party site.

Okay, this is a different conversion company than previously
mentioned.  Search backwards for "Infrared with a DSLR".  In that
article, they cite a company's website called MaxMax.  Then there is
another conversion company from another article I've cited called
LifePixel.  But **also**, it made reference to Kolari Vision for buying
a self-conversion kit.  Yep, it's the same website.  Okay, we're in
good business.  No need to worry about fakes and forgery here.

Oops, on my way navigating toward the camera tech specs, I encountered
a 404 stale link for an article that was supposed to point to the
Pentax K-1.

If it persists, I should contact site administration to have it fixed.

Oh yeah, and what is a Neutral Density (ND) filter?

20161211/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral-density_filter

Basically, it is a filter that uniformly darkens the intensity of
colors across the entire spectrum so as to allow for more photographic
and artistic creativity in selecting depth-of-field, aperture, and
motion blur.  Cool.

BUT... with modern digital cameras, is this really necessary?  Can't
all the related processing be done in software?

Wait, wait, I've got the answer.  Lasers.  If you're operating lasers,
you might positively need one of these in order to photograph the
laser without causing damage to your digital sensor due to extreme
intensities.  Yet for the laser, there is a minimum energy at which
the laser can be operated at to cast any light at all, so if you want
to make ends meet, you might need to use a filter.  Okay, now that
makes sense.

Can infrared light see through plastic integrated circuit chip
packaging?  It would be nice to be able to to microphotographs of
chips without breaking open the packages and effectively ruining the
chips.  Yeah, like seriously, photographing vintage computers in
detail!

Well, a failed web search reveals that likely, the only way for me to
find out for sure is to try it out myself with infrared photography.

Wait, did I find something?  Actually, no, this is something else.
Sensors, not methods for photographing chips.

Of course, to reiterate, plastic bags are rather transparent to
infrared light.

20161211/http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3750/why-is-a-plastic-bag-transparent-in-infrared-light

Yeah, and my own advice on this subject.  Plastic is typically known
to insulate heat.  Were it known to let heat pass through, then we'd
definitely have confidence in its transparence to infrared light.
Yes, this would indeed be a nice property, but for the most part,
things do not work out that well.

Wait, we have something right here!  But yes, it reaffirms what you've
just said previously.  Unless you use special plastic materials,
infrared light will be blocked, or if not blocked, too heavily
scattered to be able to see a clear image through the plastic.

Yeah, if only conditions were more ideal, this would provide a means
to take full photographic scans of vintage computers nondestructively.
