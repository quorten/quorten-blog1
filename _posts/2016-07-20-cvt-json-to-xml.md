Convert JSON to XML?  Wouldn't it be convenient for debugging my REST
server?  Is there a convenient library to do so?  Well, it turns out,
there isn't, at least not for the kind of conversion that you want to
do.  That is, it won't make it easy for you to apply a CSS stylesheet
to the output to view pretty-printed in your browser.
