Again, I reiterate, because this is important!

For nice sharp photos on your modern 8K UHD DSLR camera, use a prime
lens.  In particular, use a prime lens with a focal length longer than
your camera mount's flange distance.  If the focal length is shorter
than the flange distance, then that means that the lens will have
extra optical surfaces inside to compensate by means of a "reverse
projection," even if it is a prime lens.  Thus, longer focal length
prime lenses guarantee that the lens is as optically simple as
possible, and therefore will provide the best possible photographic
quality, especially in terms of sharpness.

Next least ideal is prime lenses of shorter focal lengths.

Least ideal are zoom lenses and macro-zoom lenses.

More optical surfaces mean more places for image quality to degrade,
and more places that need to be anti-reflective coated to compensate.

Is there any purpose, then, for using the lenses with less ideal
optics on a DSLR camera?  Why not just use a smartphone or
point-and-shoot in that case?  Well, as it turns out, the larger
apertures and larger, higher-resolution sensor still do provide
advantages over the cheap cameras.  Particularly, even though you
won't get better resolution, you will be able to get lower noise
floors than the cheap cameras... which does amount to better practical
resolution, even if by pixel dimensions there would otherwise be no
improvement.
