Antennas?  Software-defined radio?

Wow, how did I end up popping up all of this from Wikipedia?  Oh, I
just asked a question one day, and I got my answer on Wikipedia.
Yeah, in the past, this would have really went something more like I
asked my question, and I wondered about it, but I never really got an
answer.  Yeah, technology can really change our lives.  Change them
for the better?  I don't know about that.

To note.  You ask, why do you need a longer antenna for lower
frequency transmissions?  Well, that is because of the photoelectric
effect.  Lower-frequency electromagnetic radiation has less energy
associated with a wave of the same amplitude, so naturally, you are
going to want to amplify it via a resonant antenna in order to get a
sufficient amount of energy into your low-noise amplification circuit.

Oh yeah, and how does the discharge pattern of a capacitor work?  It
appears that there is a linear drop in voltage as the charge from the
capacitor is drained.
