Very interesting!  I found this children's book called _The Story
About Ping_.  Curiously, if you read the book, you can trace many
parallels with the modern Unix `ping` command and the Duck named
"Ping" described n the story.  Note, however, that the book was
written decades in advance of the Unix `ping` command.  In older tech
circles, apparently this book has become quite popular.  In the modern
tech community, apparently it isn't nearly as popular.
