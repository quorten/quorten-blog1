Important!  Grainy film from Caffenol?  Don't worry, carefully looking
at the results, the difference is from using ISO 400 film rather than
ISO 100 film.  So, don't worry, Caffenol can do it well.

Also, note that you _can_ reuse Caffenol for about 5 developing rolls,
but make sure to use distilled water and squeeze the air out of
storage bottles if you do store it.

Also, I've found another interesting site: Digital Truth.  They're
mostly a seller rather than a community.

Gelatin.  How many ways can it be made?  It is essential to film, the
gelatin emulsion.  How much does it affect the cost of film?

Suffice it to say that for photographic use, gelatin is very cheap and
highly stable.  Well, so point in hand.  If you want good proven
long-term stability of your emulsion, yes, traditional gelatin is the
way to go.
