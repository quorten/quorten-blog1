Wondering how to install Docker/Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi?  Okay,
installing Docker should be easy.  What about Kubernetes, when you
want to do other things on the Raspberry Pi at the same time?  Well, I
first looked at Minikube, but that may be too heavyweight, as you
first start up a virtual machine... so for now I'd just say you can
install Docker, but I'm not sure about the Kubernetes command set
story.

HypriotOS is a lightweight Raspberry Pi distribution for Docker.  Once
installed, you can join a Raspberry Pi node into a Kubernetes cluster.
