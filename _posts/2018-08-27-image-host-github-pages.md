Image hosting on GitHub pages?  What does a web search have to say
about that?

So, there is this suggestion of using GitHub issues as a clandestine
way to host images on GitHub, but I don't like it.  There is also a
recommendation to simply upload your files into a GitHub repository
and use that as web hosting file space, so long as the files are less
than 25 MB, but I don't like that either.  It's designed to host code,
not arbitrary files.

This is a very interesting and informative article on how to
efficiently host your Hugo blog in GitHub pages.

This is an interesting comparison article between Hugo and Jekyll.
The notable omission from Hugo?  It doesn't yet support plugins.
However, Hugo is still much faster than GitHub at page generation.
