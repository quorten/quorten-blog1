Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  How do you retrieve
literal copies of HTML files from the Internet Archive Wayback
Machine?  Use this nifty trick.  Append "id_" to the date of the page
you are looking to download.  This will give you the "identity."
i.e. identical, version of the page.
