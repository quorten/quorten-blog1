I'm still determined.  Is there a libre solution for 802.11ac 5 GHz
Wi-Fi?  Well, well, if you ask like that, there is a compromise you
can make.  You can make use of so-called "Wi-Fi repeaters" that
contain both a Wi-Fi and an Ethernet interface on them as a means for
you to connect your libre computer to the 802.11ac 5 GHz network.

Note that 802.11ac is only specified for 5 GHz.  2.4 GHz is provided
as a fallback on 802.11n.  Also note, despite the fact that 5 GHz has
a lot more bandwidth per-se, it is much more heavily regulated than
2.4 GHz in the interest of avoiding interference with radar devices.
So it turns out that the usable bandwidth on 5 GHz is not as great as
you would think on first thought.

Multi-user MIMO is another nice feature that 802.11ac provides.
