Some interesting highlights from the Trisquel General Free Software
forum.

This is unfortunate.

This is interesting.  Bug #1 on Ubuntu has since been closed, due to
the advent of tablets and smartphones.  Also, there exists an ethical
repository hosting page on GNU.org, which I've never seen before.
Yeah, that's probably because it's not well linked up with the rest of
the page contents.

But yeah, I do agree.  We've all known long in advance that
SourceForge.net and GitHub had their own problems... it's just that
they're so popular, and if you want to be on the same platform that
everyone else is on, that is where you go.

Point in hand: the main problem with self-hosting is the problem of
needing to create a million accounts for each self-hosted site.

Now this has some interesting things.

Caterpillar not doing well financially?  Their grand scheme: on their
leased equipment, the ability to remotely throttle or shut off the
engine when the leaser falls behind in payment.  However, this is
negligible compared to other things happening with their equipment
under resale.  From a 2 million dollars to 15 thousand dollars.  1/100
of the original price.

Many reasons why the DMCA... is horrible.
