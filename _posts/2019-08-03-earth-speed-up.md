Interesting.  For most of the length of history, Earth's rotation has
been slowing down due to tidal deceleration.  But in the last century,
Earth's rotation has been speeding up due to mantle effects.  It is
not anticipated that this will last for too long, but if a negative
leap second does happen because of this, that will really drive our
tech infrastructure out of whack.
