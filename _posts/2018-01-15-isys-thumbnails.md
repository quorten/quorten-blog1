Important!  As it turns out, the "thumbnails" view needs to be very
complicated and support multiple modes for what to display.  For
example, it also needs to be able to support displaying a "time lapse"
of an object, possibly with all angles.

Humans are "movable objects" too, albeit much more fragile than
typical artificial objects.  Humans can generally only be moved around
in standing, sitting, or laying position, or with shoulder straps with
wide body coverage.  More importantly, humans and animals tend to move
primarily by their own mechanisms rather than being carried by
something else.  Nevertheless, especially for the purpose of
organizing photos, the same visual and spatial disciplines apply.
