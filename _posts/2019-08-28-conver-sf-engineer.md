So, an interesting conversation developed on Twitter with another
engineer.

> [ME]: Unix old-timers loved printed manuals, and we can all see why

> [P1]: Who you callin' an old timer, young whippersnapper?!

> [ME]: Who am I calling an old timer?  Anyone who was smart enough to
> step up to the plate when the PC revolution was at its finest in the

> [P1]: Each generation has unique but equal challenges to overcome. I

> [P1]: While your praise is unwarranted, it is also awkwardly

So, interestingly, this conversation reaffirms some previous
statements that have been mentioned once before.  Again, I reiterate,
because this is important!  I'll summarize here.

<!-- more -->

* Like any good engineer, this engineer changes the world and shrugs
  off fame and fortune.

* Being counted among the number of considerable innovators is credit
  in its own right, regardless of the individual's personal merit.
  Part of what made the community really great back then was simply
  due to its size.  Even minor participants and key roles in helping
  the major participants simply by being available as a minor
  participant for performing minor tasks.  A strong community is a
  team together.

* We cannot understate the delivery of results that have occurred
  during the late 1980s and 1990s, regardless of the possibility that
  the effort and merit put in isn't really that much different from
  today.

* What was one of the reasons why technology moved so fast in the late
  1980s and 1990s?  The simpler technology was easy to develop a
  complete, full, and concrete understanding of, compared to the
  sprawling technology complexity of today.  Simple tasks back then
  were, in fact, really simple, and could be executed quickly and
  swiftly compared to today.

* Like every good mentor, it is great to reiterate that everyone has
  challenges, they are not just confined to one person or one
  generation.  It's just that the challenges are not the same every
  time.
