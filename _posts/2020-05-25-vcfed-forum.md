Interesting, by mention in 68kMLA, I saw a name-drop to activity
happening in `vcfed`, the Vintage Computing Federation.  They have
info not just on vintage Macintoshes and Apple II, but on a whole host
of vintage platforms.  Their forum is the go-to where most of the
activity is happening, they have a site-wide blog but it is mainly
only for vintage computing fair announcements and the like at the
moment, which are canceled/postponed for the time being due to
Coronavirus.
