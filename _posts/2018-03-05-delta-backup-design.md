* Delta backups?  Only necessary at a file level, as that faithfully
  replicates the nature of a photographic archival system.  If you
  replace one photograph with another, chances are the other
  photograph will be entirely different, so delta diffs will not be
  beneficial.

    * Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  I searched for
      this and found it, that means it's important!
