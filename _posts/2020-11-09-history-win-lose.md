The winners write the history books.  That seems to be the way it
always is with history.  Why does it have to be that way?  Well, a web
search brings some interesting insight on this.

There have been a number of times in history where the losers have
written the history books.  Like, the appraised cruelty of the Ottoman
empire, that was due to displacement of Greek philosophers in the
West.  Perhaps the most significant example of history being written
primarily by the losers is the Bible.  Most of the life of the
Israelites was under rule by some other political superior who "won"
previous wars and the like, and there are very few exceptions where
the Israelites were the "winners."  Likewise with the history of
Christianity, until period of the crusades "sullied" that reputation.

Here is the most punctual twist on the subject in question.  "History
is written by those who can write."

Okay, I'm convinced, then.  Even losers' history can be important.
