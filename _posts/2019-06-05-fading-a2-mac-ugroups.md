10 years ago, I was shortly involved in the Apple II scene, mainly in
the interest of using an Apple IIc Plus as a bridge machine to affect
a floppy-disk-based data transfer and backup of my Macintosh SE with a
40 MB internal SCSI hard disk drive.  At the time, I did note that
there were some interesting local Apple II user groups, but I never
thought about attending them at the time.  "Maybe later" was a passing
thought.

Well, now it's later, and I've got involved once again, out of the
interest of actually building the much yearned-for null modem serial
cable to connect my Macintosh SE directly to a PC RS-232 serial port.
At the earlier time, I've read the Inside Macintosh book, learned
about the trick, but never built the cable.

But, anyways, with all that cool demoscene underway that I have now,
now I want to get more involved with the local Apple II and Macintosh
Classic community.  To show off what I have, see what more cool things
I can learn, and maybe should I consider parting with the machines,
some semblance that I will personally know who I sell the machine to
and can come back for visits.

But, unfortunately, that simply has not panned out.  Checking back 10
years later, it appears that most of the local Apple II user groups
have disbanded.  Many old-timers must have left the Apple II vintage
computing scene in that period of time, and naturally there is not a
viable supply of new members to replace those who are walking out.
The community is getting sparser and more skeletal, which means the
geographical gaps between the few remaining members are growing
larger.  No longer is it easy to find an Apple II users group within
your local community, if it ever was surprisingly easy back in the
late 2000s up until the year 2010.

This list of Apple II users groups is full of broken links.

Multiple repeated web searches reveal nothing, at least nothing
locally that is.  However, there are, of course, some familiar signs
of the few, the passionate, and admittably the very young when they
started learning and programming the Apple II computer.
Unfortunately, they too are fading away.

Nowadays, of those born in the United States, it is no longer remotely
normal for a computer programmer to have first learned programming at
a young age.  It's hard to imagine that at one point in time, there
was a glut of self-starting Americans who learned computer programming
at a young age and willing to take their skills up to the next level
to kickstart a new economy.  But, that was the truth, many of these
programmers built what we came to know as Microsoft Corporation of the
1990s, that booming company with the youngest billionaire and richest
man in the world at the time.  Rightfully so because they built the
mass market software of the new economy.
