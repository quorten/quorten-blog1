Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  All manufactured
objects have a manufacturing tolerance at which the details of the
object in question are reproduced.  By simply scanning at a
sufficiently high resolution to capture that tolerance, one can
reproduce every single originally designed detail in the manufactured
object in question.

Also, human observational senses have a maximum detail level.  For
aesthetic but non-functional purposes, such as scanning scratches on
the surface of an aged manufactured object, one can scan at the limit
of human sensory perception, which may be higher than the
manufacturing tolerance of the original object.
