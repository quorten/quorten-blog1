Inspec?  Is that proprietary or open-source?  Let's check Wikipedia...
oh, this is a different Inspec.  A very old scientific database.  It's
interesting when you think about it... at one point in time, those
kinds of publications were extremely important for getting science and
engineering knowledge disseminated throughout the community.

This is the Inspec I was looking for.  Yes, it is open-source, I found
the source code on GitHub.

This is an intfrastructure monitoring system by New Relic.  It could
be pretty nice, although Prometheus may be more of the rage.
