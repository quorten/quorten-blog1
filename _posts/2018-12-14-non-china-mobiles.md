Are there are smartphones not made in China?  In short, the options
are few and far between, but yes, there are some smartphones not made
in China.  Arguably, most of the smartphones not made in China are
made elsewhere "by accident," but there is one company that is fairly
committed to keeping manufacturing in Taiwan: HTC.

This is an older article from 2012.

So, what does the Wikipedia article have to say on HTC?  Alas, HTC is
kind of pulling out of the smartphones business.  After having
collaborated on the development of the Pixel smartphone, they sold a
bunch of their smartphone talent and IP to Google in 2017.  Ah, but
from the previous article, I saw some of the Google Pixel smartphones
were made in Taiwan, although not marketed as such.  Well, there you
go.  That's where to go to look for the "modern HTC" smartphones.
