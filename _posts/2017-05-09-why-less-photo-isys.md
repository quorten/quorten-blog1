So why doesn't everyone use a photographic inventory system?  Short of
complacency, people have no other excuses due to the sheer ease of
using such a system and the dramatic payout from doing so.  Especially
the great degree of precision and short amount of time investment
required.  Well, it turns out that people are complacent, and very
many of them so.  They tend to be complacent except when a political
force says that they must be more efficient or else.  The unfortunate
reality.

So that's why you don't see very good uptake of new technologies to
improve productivity and efficiency among individual personal users.

Yeah, totally, like you don't need to draw pictures every time you
change something.

But hey!  Come on!  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  I
cannot emphasize this enough.  It is tremendously easy to photograph
objects.  Every single time I come out, I am amazed at the results
that I can get out with so little effort put in.
