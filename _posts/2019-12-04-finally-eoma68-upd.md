After a long wait of seeing that EOMA 68 was going
nowhere... surprise, there is a recent update.  Alas, it pretty much
confirms what I've said, it's going nowhere very quickly.  So, what
was the pproblem this time?  Issues with Ball Grid Array (BGA)
soldering gone wrong is the suspect, X-ray scans are needed to
confirm.  When a PCB is not accurately printed, oversized copper
traces can result in the solder balls spreading too far to the extent
that a solder bridge can form.  So, now you know, BGA soldering truly
is a challenge, even when you have printed circuit boards.
