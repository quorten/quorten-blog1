Responsibly made in China?  What does that mean?  That's China's
efforts to improve the environmental friendliness of their
manufacturing processes.  For many years, U.S. companies would ship
their manufacturing to China specifically so that they could sidestep
the costs associated with the requirements for environmentally
friendly manufacturing.  But, looks like that "cost-saving" is coming
to an end, with future Chinese legislation.  Well... that's assuming
everyone obeys those laws, which Chinese companies have developed a
reputation for skirting their own laws of a sort.
