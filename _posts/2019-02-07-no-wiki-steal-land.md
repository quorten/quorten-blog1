Does Wikipedia have anything interesting on "steal the land"?  I found
no direct article, but found an interesting article on a book called
"Steal This Book."  The book was about being a hippie, stealing your
way through the world rather than paying.  The book had to be
self-published and carried through another publishing company as no
reputable publisher wanted to be listed directly as the publisher.
Also, the book turned out to be a bestseller book, despite having no
advertising in newspapers accepted and spreading only through word of
mouth.  The author admitted that it was a little bit embarrassing to
have such a political uprising book appear in a bestselling books
list.
