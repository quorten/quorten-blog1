There is a Gameboy Advance emulator for the black and white Macintosh?
Yep.

Not convinced to replace leaking electrolytic capacitors?  Okay, take
this.  One forum member Dog Cow had the RIFA﻿ safety﻿ capacitor blow up.
"And it's always so dramatic! Just huge clouds of gray smoke pouring
out of the vents like there was a dirty fire inside the case!! Too bad
I didn't have my camera handy."

Beware if your floppy disk drive sticks, don't force it!  It could be
that the lubricant dried up and turned into glue, open it up, clean
the old lubricant off, and put in new lubricant.

Also, another interesting tidbit of advice, don't put floppy disks to
the left side of your Macintosh, the analog board and power supply
generate a considerable amount of EMI that can mess with them and
erase them.  The right side is safer, or at least far away to any
side.
