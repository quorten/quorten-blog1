So, I happened to randomly look up "reticle" and Wikipedia, then I got
thinking... I've already thought about this before.  Are gun sights a
good place to look to for inspiration on creating a cheap camera
viewfinder?  Earlier, I concluded the answer was "no" because the
primary purpose of a gun sight is to focus only on a narrow center
target, but for a camera, you want to know the full details that are
in the field of view.  Nevertheless, some of the information is
interesting and insightful.

Mary Babnik Brown donated her hair for use in the crosshairs of the
Norden bombsight.  The Norden bombsight was intended to be highly
accurate and advantageous over previous designs, but real-world use
proved it wasn't much better.
