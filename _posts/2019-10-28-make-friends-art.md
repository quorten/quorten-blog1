So I was wondering, how effective do people actually build friendships
starting with someone met at a party, which they might not have
certainty of meeting again?

Failed search.

On the other hand, I found this interesting article on building
friendships as an adult that compares it to dating.  That seems to be
a common theme, as I've seen in a previous similar article, as I've
stated in a [similar previous article on the subject]({{ site.baseurl
}}/blog/2019/07/25/car-meetups-culture).  Well, yeah, but I have my
suspicions that the tendency to be slow at building friendships is
more common among non-tech people than among tech people.  Because
everything moves faster in the tech field.

But, what is particularly interesting about this article is how the
author stated that she peaked in social terms at age 5.  Wow, it's
quite an exciting read, that one part.
