Server lift?  Does Wikipedia have any information about that?
Unfortunately, no.  On the other hand, I read some interesting
information about Usenet.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Usenet is a very
important part of the history of the Internet.  Although the
technology per se has fallen out of favor nowadays, it has influenced
many important parts of Internet culture.  Why, that's an
understatement.  Even in areas that are far displaced from "Internet
culture," some of the terminology that has originated from Usenet,
such as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) is used as serious business
work terminology.

UDP = Usenet Death Penalty?  Interesting, although obsolete.

Endless September, enternal September.  The original Usenet community
had an outdated understanding of the scope of the Internet, one where
new users only reach as far as new college campus recruits.
Interestingly, as mentioned by some of the external links, AOL users
on Usenet were immediately labeled as a nuisance, independent of the
content of their messages or their behavior.  Also, AOL spend _a lot_
of money to send out all those CDs with a free AOL subscription for a
month on them.
