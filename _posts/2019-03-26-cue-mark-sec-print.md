So, this is interesting that I haven't noticed this.  There are cue
marks on movie films?  Traditional movie film reels are 14 to 20
minutes in length, so a full feature-length film must be delivered on
multiple reels of film.  Inside a projectionist's booth, there would
be two movie projects set up side-by-side: one to display the actively
running film, the other one to queue up the next reel in preparation
for the switchover.  The projectionist would watch the upper right
hand corner of the running film for a first burnt out dot to flash.
This would indicate to them that it is time to start the motor on the
second projector, with the film running starting at 8 seconds of
countdown.  Then there would be a second burt out dot flash a 7
seconds later.  One second later the projectionist would execute the
switchover.

So, that says a lot about the old days of film and cinema.  Yeah, it
definitely wasn't as easy to run a movie theater back then as it is
today.  In the last generation of film before the digital switchover,
there was an alternate projector design that could run off of one
really big long reel of film, thus not requiring switchovers through
three or more separate reels of film to show a movie.  Today's digital
cinema knows of none of the problems of running a cinema in time's
past.  Heck, modern digital theaters don't even need a human at all at
the projector.

Interestingly, cue marks were also used in analog television.
However, they are no longer used in digital television due to the time
delays (sometimes delaying by a seconds) caused by the digital
compression encoding process.  In general, with digital media,
out-of-band signaling is used.

Coded anti-piracy, some of the codes used on movie film reels in order
to make illegal copies more traceable.  Some of the codes resulted in
significant visual quality deterioration.  Similar codes have found
their way into digital cinema.

These are some interesting articles classifying the various bootleg
techniques used to make illegal copies.  Telesync = audio and video
synchronized duplication via camcorder.  Cam = unsynchronized
duplication via camcorder.  Telecine = the professional video
recording duplication technique, but in the case of bootleg, being
used for illegal purposes.

These are interesting security codes found on currency.  EURion
constellation = a pattern of circles that is easy to detect to prevent
counterfeiting.  Digimarc barcode = a more concealed proprietary
barcode format used to prevent counterfeiting.
