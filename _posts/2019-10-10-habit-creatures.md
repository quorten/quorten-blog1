So, I've been thinking about many things, and trying to answer this
question.  Why does innovation take so long?  Why does the consumer
sector generally lag behind the state-of-the-art of technology, with
the exception of entertainment?  I have lots more to say on this
subject, with more in context to the particular questions, but for
now, I wanted to highlight the overaching point and observation:
Humans are creatures of habit.  Often times humans can fail to take
advantage of innovation simply out of habit.

So, what does the Internet have to say about this?  A lot.  Here I
highlight just a few relevant articles.

On the flip-side, humans are also creatures of adaptation.  And
although for most people, adaptation is relatively slow, all that was
needed was a tiny bit for humans to change the world, and that's how
we got to where we are today.

Wow, and I read this, and it sounds so unusual.  Asking family members
to help with habit changes for exercise?  That doesn't happen around
me, chances are things are the same for you too.
