Wow, interesting, the PowerPC Mac OS Classic had a sophisticated
graphing calculator program bundled as part of the operating system.
But how was it developed?  It was fully a clandestine effort of laid
off Apple contractors/employees getting together to support a
skunkworks project unofficially, then try to work it into the system
disk image that shipped with the new Macintosh computers.  Using old
badges to gain access to Apple property even when they were not
authorized to do so, then tailgating into the property when their
badges were deactivated by security.  Then they retroactively made it
legally legitimate by defining it as a partnership with an external
company, a matter of fact of having been assigned "external vendor"
badges later in the project.

Personally, I don't approve of the general approach, but as they say,
the practice was somewhat relatable at the company at the time, just
that they took it to extremes because they were not on payroll or
under any facility access whatsoever.
