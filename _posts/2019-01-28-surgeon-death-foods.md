So you see this in random ads, so you search for this rather than
clicking through, what do you see?  Basically, this is a vegetable
company trying to promote their party line hoping you buy more of
their foods and saying in the process that high fructose corn syrup
can build up insulin resistance and lead to diabetes if taken too
much.  This other studies note this is mainly a problem with processed
foods and isn't really a problem with fresh fruits that naturally
contain fructose as they have other things that slowdown the release
of the fructose into your blood stream.
