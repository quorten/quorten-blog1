Suppose you make your own hand-wound inductor.  How do you measure
inductance so you know what kinds of circuits it can be used in?
Well, as it turns out, there is a clever trick you can use that
involves using an oscilloscope to compare its output curves with a
reference input curve at a sine wave frequency.  Then once you
determine the parameters of these curves, you can plug the numbers
into some equations to calculate the inductance, in henrys (H).
Typically, microhenrys.
