Interesting, Utah has an emerging tech scene as "Silicon Slopes"?
Indeed it does, and some of the companies have a heavy focus on
marketing from, you bet it, past Mormon missionaries.  Lots of
interesting things are saiid in this article, it's worth a good read
of its own right.  But inevitably, I am left without summarizing much
in my own article.
