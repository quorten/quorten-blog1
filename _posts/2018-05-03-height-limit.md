Ever wonder why amusement parks use height limits?  Why measure height
if what they want to get at is age?  Well, in some cases height limits
are appropriate, when they relate to the restraint system and seating
used in the ride.  If the rider is too small or too big, they might
not securely fit in the restraints.  Otherwise, it is merely a proxy
for what they really want to measure, psychological traits.  Why do
they still use it?  Because height is very easy for a ride operator to
measure.  Psychology, not so much.
