So, I've been just about fed up with my cheap Foto&Tech Pentax IR
remote release trigger.  It's not working at the moment, and I can't
quite tell if it is because my button hack needs to be adjusted, the
battery needs to be replaced, or the entire thing has just failed due
to too much hackery.  The battery voltage looks good, but who knows,
maybe it is just extra picky.

In any case, now I know that if I am doing just internal studio remote
release shoots in a studio environment, there is no need to go
cableless.  A cable trigger, by virtue of not having a battery, is one
less part to fail that could get in the way of my productivity.

So, shopping around for the cable release trigger, unfortunately it
appears that there are also complaints with the quality of the
official cable release.  Really?  Not only do their remotes have their
downsides, but even a simple cable release comes with downsides too?
Now I've already bought the IR remote from Foto&Tech and its button
was too cheap, now I don't know if I want to bother with buying their
cable release.

But, here's the really good news.  The Pentax CS-205 cable release is
simply a standard 3.5mm stereo audio jack.  That's easy enough to
build my own, wire one push button from left channel to ground for
half-push, another push button from right channel to ground for
pull-push, and you're in business!
