Of course, the ongoing problem with generic scanner data is that you
must transform data from the sensor into some sort of format that can
be presented on a digital display or printed.  Often times the most
useful transformation form is to make a duplicate of the object that
is as close to the original as possible.  In the case of sensor data
that is meant for this target, the solution to the problem of
presenting the data is rather simple.  Just run through the process of
making it into a duplicate of the real object.

So really, what separates versions of the same file format from
different file formats?  When you think about it, the main thing that
separates here is the existence of forwards and backwards
compatibility.
