Ansible notes.

What is this whole Jinja2 thing?  Here is the documentation on how to
use Jinja2 to create templates, so that you don't make mistakes when
you are authoring one.

* A Jinja is also Japanese for a Shinto temple.  So why the name
  Jinja?  Is it because this system is so "transformative"?
