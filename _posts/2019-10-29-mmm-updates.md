So, what's been going on with the Mr. Money Mustache blog?  I presume
not too much interesting.  But, hold on, this is a noteworthy article
to read.  Stock index funds might not be a good way to invest?  No,
don't worry, it's not happening yet, we've just had some warnings from
a notable economist that it _might_ happen.

Safety is an expensive illusion?  Surely there's got to be some sense
in safety, right?  Oh, yes, there is.  But what this article goes into
is a debunking of the _vernacular_ viewpoint on safety, and why it is
not good for your life in general to take such a hyper-sensitized
approach to it.
