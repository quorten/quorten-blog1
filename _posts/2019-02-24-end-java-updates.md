So, yes, as it turns out, I still have some web software that requires
Java, namely my smart switch for seeing the port use status.  Perhaps
I should look into seeing if I can get the same information over SNMP.
Anyways, because I happened to be looking around the now difficult
ordeal of running a Java applet on a modern computer, I found this
interesting statement from Oracle that Java will no longer be publicly
available for business users.
