Apple Ireland, started as a manufacturing facility, in fact their
first location outside of the U.S.  But pretty quickly after its
founding, Apple realized the tax advantages of Ireland and built up
the Apple Sales headquarters there, which is primarily responsible for
handling money matters of sales in European countries.  Interestingly,
though for a moment I suspected Apple's headquarters may be in Ireland
like Medtronic recently did, Apple is still headquartered in the
United States.  It's just that their Ireland location is a significant
subsidiary.

Apple iPhones made from rejected parts?  Okay, now this is pretty
interesting.  Wow, and the biggest fraud yet related to Apple iPhones.
Really tough when you're a company like Apple.
