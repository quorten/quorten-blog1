Li-Fi is still on the radar.  Where do you buy it?  When will it be
ready for mass-market use?

This is an interesting article on some of the technical details on
Li-Fi.  It introduces some important buzzwords.

* VLC: Visible Light Communications
* FSO: Free-Space Optical
* OWC: Optical Wireless Communications
* UV: Ultraviolet
* IR: Infrared

So, I think if you want to transmit light in both directions,
you need bright illuminators on both sides of the connection.

Apparently Li-Fi was not good enough for use in BMW's industrial car
manufacturing plant, but looking at the numbers stated, like latency
of 20ms versus 5ms, that is still plenty good enough for
PC/laptop/tablet/smartphone computer communications use.

Okay, let's search on Amazon.  It's all books!  No products involved
or available.

For sure, however, Li-Fi is growing in mindshare numbers, though not
yet in products being sold.

If you're looking for devices on the market, for sure search for
free-space optical (FSO) wireless.  Optical Wireless Communications
(OWC) is another good buzzword.
