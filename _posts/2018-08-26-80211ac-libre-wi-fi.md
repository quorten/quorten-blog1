Is there libre software friendly hardware for Wi-fi on 802.11ac?  The
short answer: it looks like there isn't.  There is the `ath10k` driver
available for Linux that provides 802.11ac support, but it requires a
firmware blob to be loaded, unlike the `ath9k` driver that only
provides support up to 802.11n.  So, unfortunately, if you want to
stick to only blob-less libre-friendly Wi-Fi hardware, you've got to
stick to 802.11n.
