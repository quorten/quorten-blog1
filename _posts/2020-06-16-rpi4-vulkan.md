OpenCL on Raspberry Pi 4?  Surely there's some info out there, isn't
there?  Well, yes.  Now, here's the trick.  Although Raspberry Pi 4
doesn't support OpenCL (yet), support for Vulkan is planned.  Vulkan
on Raspberry Pi 4?  Awesome!  Why, that's even better than OpenCL
support.  It's not out and about yet... purportedly it is 6 months of
development before they release an initial version.  Also, Vulkan very
much relies on 64-bit support, so a 64-bit OS is a must to support
Vulkan.  Which, fortunately, Raspberry Pi 4 does have official support
out and about.
