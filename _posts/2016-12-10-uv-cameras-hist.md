Wow, interesting article on UV photography with a DSLR camera.  In
fact, one of the first!  Nikon D1X.  And it worked quite well, as far
as the sensor was capable.  So, what do you need to do?  The main
thing you need to do is get the right lenses.  Then, make sure you
prevent any stray light from entering the viewfinder, and take long
exposures with exposure compensation, due to the low light levels of
ultraviolet light.

Interesting site, why don't I take a look at the home page?

Wow, interesting, the Wikipedia article makes citation to the same
person who wrote that site!

So wait.  Wait, wait, and I thinking this properly?  Actually, the
first digital cameras were DSLR cameras?  Not compact cameras?  Have I
been fooled?  I think I have.  Er, wait, wait, let me think this
through... no, I haven't been fooled.  In fact, the first digital
cameras were video cameras, camcorders, of course.  Then the
technology slowly, but rather early on, migrated into DSLR cameras.

I guess, the point I want to make is, first compact digital CCD
sensors were used in camcorders, then they were used in DSLR cameras,
and later on they were used in mass-market compact film cameras.

APS-H?  How does that compare to APS-C?  It is a lower crop factor,
meaning we've got a sensor area more comparable to the 35 mm
full-frame.

Okay, I have to see the article, on digital camera.

20161210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera  
20161210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_camera#Digital_cameras

Yep, I was definitely fooled, though.  DSLR cameras have been around
for quite some time, actually.  It's just that, well, taking into
consideration what was said in the Wikipedia article on medium format
cameras, it's probably safe to say that the general consumer and
market disposition was that the most advanced automatic technology was
available in mass-market compact cameras.  Hence the widely held (and
in some sense, accurate) belief that compact digital cameras came to
market first, then DSLRs became popular later on.

**Full-frame** DSLR cameras were definitely a later development, though.
The first DSLR cameras used crop sensors, so yes, the previous
statement is true in some sense.  The first DSLR cameras were
technically not too much better than later compact digital cameras in
terms of sensor resolution and sensor area.  But yes, they definitely
did have optical quality advantage, just not nearly as much advantage
as today's DSLR cameras have.

Okay, wait, let's see if I can find better history on camcorders.  No
I can't, but I can find a lot of interesting articles on disc rot.
And oh yeah, the M-DISC again, that's interesting that we also have a
Wikipedia article on it.

* Take note: M-DISC supports the BDXL 100 GB capacity format.

BTRFS is now stable!

What?!  Discs that are designed to become unreadable?

20161210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-D  
20161210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexplay

Yeah, the Flexplay article has extensive evidence of how disliked the
idea is.  The truth is, people don't like disposable things.

Okay, so now you're telling me, the quality differences between CMOS
and CCD sensors are now negligible.  Also, both CCD and CMOS sensors
use the _same_ photodiodes, so the only difference is that of
architecture, where CCDs have more image area than CMOS sensors, but
again, the disadvantages of CMOS sensors are disappearing.  Cool.

So definitely, it turned out that I did not get an adequate historical
treatment on digital image sensors in video cameras by reading the
camcorder article.

Interesting.  You can also do ultraviolet photography with the
Raspberry Pi NoIR camera.
