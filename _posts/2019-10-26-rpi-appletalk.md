So, you wanted to know how to build an AppleTalk Raspberry Pi bridge
to the Internet?  Here it is, I found the information when searching
for a different topic.  Also, I've found a URL to the Inside AppleTalk
documentation and some other useful AppleTalk information.

In the old days, people had to use an expensive Shiva FastPath router
box if they wanted to connect a Macintosh to the TCP/IP Internet
