Now, this is interesting.  The Ngwenya Mine in Swaziland is the oldest
artificial human mine currently known, at 41,000 to 43,000 years old.
Various iron ores were mined from here.

In modern times, however, efforts to revive commercial mining have not
been so successful.  After the flood, foreign mining companies left.
A few years later, mining operations native to the local country
started, but not without a lot of corruption and eventual cancellation
once again.
