When was the National Science Foundation formed?  Oh, 1950s.  It's
hard to imagine a world where the influence of modern computerized
science, especially that sponsored under the National Science
Foundation, European Science Foundation, or otherwise, is not the
norm.

The Wikipedia article on the National Science Foundation unfortunately
does not have all that interesting and insightful history as I would
have expected, though.
