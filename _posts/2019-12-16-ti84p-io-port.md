So, I've noticed that the TI 84 Plus calculator's I/O port is indeed a
2.5 mm audio jack.  Could this mean that it is a standard UART serial
port?  No, unfortunately it is not, apparently it uses some other
custom, non-UART style protocol for communications.  Oh, bummer, it
was so close to being convergent technology.  The GnuBee uses an 3.5
mm audio jack for its UART serial connector.

Nevertheless, there is a pretty good Arduino code library to interface
with the custom protocol.
