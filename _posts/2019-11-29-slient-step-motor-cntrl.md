Important!  Want to use stepper motors?  Make sure you consider using
"silent step" stepper motor controllers.  These achive reduced noise
level from stepper motors by limiting the current they supply to only
what is necessary to achieve the desired motion.  More current to a
non-moving stepper motor contributes to the noise that it makes.

Yes, and on top of this, if you want more precision, you also want to
use a stepper motor controller with micro-stepping capabilities.
