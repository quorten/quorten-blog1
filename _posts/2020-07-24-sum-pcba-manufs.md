Oh wow, a simple search on tab routing brought me to two more good
turnkey PCB manufacturers.  Basically, it is the "mouse ears" and
"mouse bites" panelization technique.

Bittele Electronics Inc (7pcb) is located in Toronto, Canada.
Screaming Circuits apperas to be located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.

Looking at Digi-Key's list of PCB printers, and of those that offer
PCBs in quantity of one, I discovered another U.S.-based PCB
assembler, Advanced Circuits (4PCB), based in Colorado, USA.

Sierra Circuits (California, USA) also does turn-key:

Precision Circuit Board Source, LLC (low quantity runs from
California, USA; high quantity runs from Asia-based manufacturing
facility):

Actually, only two PCB board houses listed on Digi-Key are circuit
board printers only:

* Royal Circuit Solutions Inc (California, USA)
* Sunshine Global Circuits (Shenzen, China)

So, let's roll together all of the prospective PCB assemblers and
catalog the location and minimum order quantities of them all.

* JLC PCB (Hong Kong), min. qty. 5

* Seeed Fusion (Shenzen, China), min. qty. 5, lower quantity possible
  on bigger boards

* NextPCB (Shenzen, China), min. qty. 5, lower quantity possible on
  bigger boards

* Bittele Electronics Inc (Toronto, Canada), min. qty. 1

* Screaming Circuits (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), min. qty. 1

* Advanced Circuits (Colorado, USA), min. qty. 1*: Minimum quantity of
  one is possible if you choose "labor only" which means that you will
  do all the part sourcing yourself, send them in, and they will only
  be responsible for pick-and-place to put them on the board.
  Otherwise, minimum quantity is 5.

* Sierra Circuits (California, USA), min. qty. 3

* Precision Circuit Board Source, LLC (low quantity runs from
  California, USA; high quantity runs from Asia-based manufacturing
  facility), min. qty. 16
