Commercial motor vehicles are subject to randomized roadside
inspections by police officers, in order to determine that they and
the driver are roadworthy.  Interesting.  Commercial drivers are
definitely allowed less "freedom" than the uninitiated may think, but
for a good reason, given the safety implications and endemically very
high danger of the roads and motor vehicles.  Noteworthy is that the
introduction of smartphones has made electronic logging much easier
for commercial drivers, and "Form and Manner" violations of missing
dates on the log basically vanish.

I happened to find this at random when searching for documentation on
Chef Inspec.
