What is an inventory?  Well, an inventory is different things to
different people.  To an insurance company, it is a listing of things
for which replacements may need to be purchased.  For a police
department, it is a listing of belonging that may need to be recovered
in the event of a theft.  For a business, it may be a list of goods
that are ultimately going to be sold or consumed in a business
process.  For a theater technician, it is a list of props or artifacts
that are needed for a play or movie.  It could also be asset tracking.
My inventory system aims to be a general purpose solution that is
suitable for all of those things and more.  Yes, I know, very
ambitious.

So, you were talking about different density levels for data on
objects in inventory?  Talk ABC analysis, as in "A items," "B items,"
and "C items."
