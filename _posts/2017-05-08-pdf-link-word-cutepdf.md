Okay, just checking.  How do you create a PDF from a Word document in
early versions of Microsoft Word that have hyperlinks?  The short
answer is that you can't, you can only create PDF documents without
hyperlinks.

Oh wait, can't CutePDF do that?  Well maybe it can.  Uh, don't botter,
it's proprietary and dangerous too.
