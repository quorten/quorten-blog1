Intel kills off Core i9 9900k speciality dodecahedron packaging?  Wow,
now this is interesting.  Those marketing pictures showing the
dodecahedron picture you've been seeing?  Those were actually
representative of the actual retail box that the CPU was sold packaged
in, it wasn't just a cute marketing logo.  Wow, now that is really
interesting.  Alas, the fancy packaging has come to an end, after
Intel sent out a product change notification (PCN).

Really, I'm with what some of those other folks were thinking, those
photos of bulk packaging arrangements really looks like a box of
chocolates.

This was purportedly first inspired by, and meant to compete with, AMD
Threadripper packaging.  Well, it's not odd shaped like Intel i9
9900k.  Just that it's huge and has rounded corners.  No heat sink is
actually included in all that extra space, though, just like the Intel
dodecahedron box.

Related, I decided to do a general web search on retail packaging.
Like, what is it about retail packaging that it has to be so snazzy
and all that?  Well, I am just told that it must be, under the
assumption that is directly relates to more sales.  In other words,
people are literally walking into stores shopping for boxes, not
products.  Well, I can definitely believe that in the case of grocery
stores and supermarkets, just take a look at the lack of detail on an
average person's shopping list and compare that with the contents of
their receipts.

Interestingly, there are a number of sites where you
can buy custom retail packaging design and manufacturing services
from.
