I reiterate.  The cost of RFID chips.  The advantage is that they can
be read at a distance, even those without batteries.  Thus, roaming
device's locations can be detected very quickly.  The disadvantage is
that they are more expensive than optical barcodes.  Only optical
object recognition can track objects at a distance, but again, this
requires more sophisticated computer technology, both hardware and
software.  Again, as has already been the case in the discussion of
cellphones, without advanced technology, the only way to be able to
locate objects efficiently is to keep consistent home locations.  If
an object's location keeps changing, you've got to keep making
database updates at a high frequency.  And, as I've indicated early,
you've got to pay the price for speed, and speed is only possible
using newer technologies.

Just to reiterate the point, to be clear.  One of the main problems
with RFIDs is that they have to include a certain amount of metal, and
metal still is expensive.  Thus, RFIDs will very likely be "more
expensive" for a long time into the future.  Maybe advancements in
organic electronics will drop the cost of RFIDs, but for now, we know
that RFIDs are simply more expensive than other solutions.
