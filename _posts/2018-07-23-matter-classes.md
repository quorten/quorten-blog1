Metal or non-metal?  Yeah, really useful actually for data on scanned
objects.

* Metal
* Non-metal
* Composition of discrete metal and non-metal parts

Now there are classifications of both metals and non-metals too.

<!-- more -->

Metals:

* Magnetic metal (iron)
* Non-magnetic metal (everything else)
    * Aluminum (most popular)
    * Copper
    * Copper alloys
        * Brass
    * Silver
    * Silver alloys
    * Gold
    * Chrome alloys
* Rare earth metal

Non-metals:

* Plastic
    * Polystyrene
    * Polyethyline
        * HDPE
        * LDPE
        * PET/PETE
    * Polypropylene
    * Polyester
        * PLA
    * Nylon
    * Polyester-nylon blend
    * Polycarbonate
    * ABS
    * PC-ABS
* Plastic fabric
* Wood
    * Plywood
    * Oak
    * Ash
    * Elm
* Paper
* Cardboard
* Other fabric
    * Cotton
    * Fleece
    * Wool
    * Silk

Now we need easy and fun ways/tools to detect the other material
types.  By far it appears the metal detector is the easiest, though.
