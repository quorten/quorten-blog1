I have been using VNC recently but suffering from slow performance.
What is the cause of this?  Purportedly it could be reliance on GPU
communications that end up turning slow, or just some configuration
gone wrong on my particular GNU/Linux distribution.

So, here I put my notes from my search, but a solution to my
particular problem is still inconclusive.

How to use VNC and avoid slowness.
