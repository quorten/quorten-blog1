Earlier, I've mentioned the Zero Phone on my blog, but I haven't
provided any more links to detailed updates, status, or information on
the project.  Where is that project at right now?  Oh, very
interesting.  Right now, it's still at an early development stage, but
there is a wiki with a whole bunch of information on how to build your
own Zero Phone by hand.  Well, at least for building most of the
parts.  It is a great example of how to purchase and assemble the
electronics components of modern style surface mount device
electronics, and how to build together a complete embedded system
around a Raspberry Pi Zero, featuring a display and keyboard.

Printed circuit boards?  You can buy the printed circuit boards custom
printed from manufacturers such as OSHPark (U.S.-based) or DirtyPCBs
(China-based).
