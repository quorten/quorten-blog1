First signs, skeptic but pointing out the advantage of the increased
openness over Windows.

The story continues, Android's increased openness is a clear advantage
over Windows, something Microsoft previously had the most of but is
now throwing away.

Android really is the new Windows.  For sure the evidence all points
toward its advantages and successes that have all come from Windows
decades earlier.

A critical retrospective.  Besides everything that was thus already
mentioned, even Bill Gates saw where the future was heading.  The
advances of the World Wide Web and Internet.  And, you could even be
so cheeky to put it as this, Bill Gates even saw when Microsoft was
clearly falling short of the future goals, leaving an opportunity for
competitors to jump in and pick up the continued technological
progress where Microsoft left off.

But, we're not fully to the end of this until Android realizes the
scope of security vulnerabilities that was realized historically on
Microsoft Windows.  This is despite having a security framework
built-in, but one thing that hasn't changed: it's all through the
clever use of software bugs to get what an attacker wants out of a
modern computer.  Yes, even when there wasn't a fundamental design
error in designing the security framework.

Now Microsoft is working to make their software work on Android, so
that an Android phone can function as a Microsoft phone.
