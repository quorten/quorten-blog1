KiCad.  Wow, impressive list of sponsors going on here.  Many hands
working to support KiCad, and how it became so successful.

Here is another company for full robotic pick-and-place PCB assembly.
Beyond JLC PCB, here is NextPCB.  Where are the based?  China...  oh,

But, nevertheless, I concede.  They are UL certified, so if you want
to avoid ham-handed manufacturing defects from your DIY manufacturing
