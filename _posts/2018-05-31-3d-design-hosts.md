So, you're wondering, yes there is Thingiverse, but what are all the
options for 3D print design file hosting and sharing?  In particular,
what are the more formidable alternatives to Thingiverse?

Well, well.  Sure, I've known that GitHub has been an option for quite
some time now, but this GitHub pages template makes it look even more
competitive.  There is a successor to this too, which is supported by
the RepRap community.

Alas, the fate of this Thing Tracker must be the same as the fate of
FastCGI: With the main, official specification website no longer
function, it must be obvious that the community has basically
abandoned this as any form of standard.  Sad but true.  And, just like
FastCGI, it was a great idea too... unfortunately this time through, I
don't think it is true to say that there are any successor
technologies to replace this.
