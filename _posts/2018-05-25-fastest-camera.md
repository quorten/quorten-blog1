So, what really is the fastest camera technology you can get in 2018?
Well, as it turns you, I'm disappointed.  The fastest technology isn't
that much faster than the technology I currently have.

Standard SD max write speed is 25 MB/s.  UHS-I brings that up to 104
MB/s, and UHS-II brings that up to 312 MB/s.  CompactFlash has been
retired from updates, so it's not getting any faster in speed.  The
new standard to replace it is XQD, based off of PCI-E and with a max
speed of 1 GB/s.

<!-- more -->

So there you have it.  The fastest is only faster than standard SD max
speed by a factor of 40, not quite the factor of 100 or 1000 that I
was aiming for.  That means that making an ADF more than 40 times
faster is a wasted effort, at least until the rest of the digital
system catches up in speed.

Now what about the storage equation?  Hard disk drive storage density
is practically limited at 1 TB per square inch, at least until some
compelling other magnetic technology comes along.  What does that mean
for a 3.5 inch hard disk drive?  Okay, so some estimates.

    (3.5 / 2)^2 * 3.14 = 9.616 inch^2
    = 9.616 TB
    9.616 TB * 4 heads = 38.464 TB
    9.616 TB * 6 heads = 57.696 TB

So, as it turns out, future 3.5 inch hard disk drives will _just
barely_ satisfy your storage density per cost growth requirements, but
only for the next generation (i.e. 5 years and growth factor of 10).
Beyond that, you'll be stuck.

* Consumer hard drives are limited to a maximum of 5 platters.
