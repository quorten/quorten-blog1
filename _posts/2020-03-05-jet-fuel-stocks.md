In my previous search for economic complements to airlines that are
experiencing a similar stock market drop, I found nothing.  However,
after some discussion with other folks and seeing it mentioned in
stock news, I did find secondary companies being affected by the drop
in airline activity.  Energy companies... but not just any energy
companies.  Specifically, those energy companies that are involved in
the business of jet fuel.  This is a bit more challenging to search
out because it is not as well advertised, but if you scourer for the
hints you'll find the relationship is quite striking.  Not only are
airline stocks heavily dependent on oil prices, vice versa is also
true: decreases in the aviation industry also has a similar effect on
the profitability of the companies that fuel them.

The biggest negative impact appears to go to Phillips 66 and World
Fuel Services.  Guessing from the few info sources I've read, I'd
assume that's because they have a strong presence in California and a
lot of international flights terminate at California.  And the news of
California declaring a state of emergency in light of the
Coronavirus... that's going to have a pretty big impact on California
businesses.  For World Fuel Services, well that's because they were
spun off primarily as a jet fuel company, so of course they're getting
hit hard.  And BP, well they're a big company with diversification and
they've also been selling their jet fuel business to other companies,
so they're hardly hit that much.
