Okay... so I've been running my new PoE splitters for a while, and I
touch them when working around with the cables and notice they are
warm.  They are warm... what does that mean?  It means that they are
wasting energy into heat, literally.  Yeah, like the old wall wart
power supplies that would feel warm to the touch.  Several Watts of
energy are being wasted into heat.

Okay, okay, so the question comes down to, what is the typical energy
efficiency of PoE splitters?  Apparently, it is touted to be around
80%.  Okay, when I think about it... yeah, that's probably right.  The
PoE splitter itself is smaller than old-fashioned wall warts, which
means that if it feels about as warm as the old wall warts, then there
is simply not as much heat required to get to that particular warmth.
So instead of wasting "several" Watts, maybe only a "few" Watts of
energy are wasted.  Say, 1 Watt wasted of a 5 Watt power supply is not
too bad.  Although, if you have low-power equipment, maybe it is
really only consuming 1 Watt on its own, so you're doubling the power
consumption due to efficiency losses.
