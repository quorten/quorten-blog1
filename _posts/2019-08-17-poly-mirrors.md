Polygonal mirrors for deflecting light?  You're in good business, a
lot of these are made for the laser industry and laser printers.  You
just got to make sure you use the right search engine terminology
otherwise no useful results will turn up.

One innovative thing that can be done with polygonal mirrors is to
have each face at a slightly different angle so that the polygonal
mirror can scan out multiple parallel projected lines (i.e. multiple
light planes) from a single laser beam.
