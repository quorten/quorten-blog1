So now I'm wondering.  If you get a sensor cleaning anti-static brush,
is it okay to charge it up with a blower brush?

Well, now this has been consistently interesting.  Are you wondering
about the dust cleaning problem for DSLR cameras?  Many decades back,
most of the dust problems and dust cleaning methods/techniques have
been discussed and mastered with vinyl records.  Of course, because
vinyl records are used over and over again and again, so dust will
tend to get stuck to them that needs to be removed for reuse.  Of
course, make sure you don't try to use the exact same instruments used
for cleaning vinyls to clean a DSLR camera sensor, or else you will
get big troubles.

In regard to cleaning film negatives, I guess you can say the same,
that the best cleaning methods for film negatives are those that are
best for cleaning a DSLR camera sensor.

So, for some good tips from the info source.  Relating to brush
pressure, for vinyl, the weight of the brush is the max pressure that
some people recommend.  So, staying more gentle than this for DSLR
sensor cleaning should be good.

So, now the final verdict. Be forewarned about using anti-static guns.
_If_ there is a static charge on the surface, an anti-static gun can
remove it.  Otherwise, an anti-static gun can end up charging up a
surface and making it attract even more dust.  For this reason, you
probably want to avoid anti-static guns entirely for film use.
Additionally, devices such as the Zerostat are overpriced: you can
build your own by modifying a butane lighter.  All you need is a
piezoelectric crystal charging element or two, and maybe a blower fan.
