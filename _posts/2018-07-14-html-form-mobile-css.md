Important!  Make sure you also set the viewport width to your device
width for pages that are designed to render on mobiles.

But, the best point in hand.  Want to do accurate testing on mobile
devices from desktops and laptops?  Make sure you use the same browser
that will be running on the mobile device, and then put that into
mobile device emulation mode.

Also, don't forget.  The terminology that pundits are coining today
for CSS that works on smartphones (as well as tablets, desktops, and
laptops)?  Responsive design.
