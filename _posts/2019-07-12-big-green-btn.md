This is an interesting software project that one of my coworkers
previously worked on.  Initially it was called "Concert Cam," but
later when they started bringing it to other non-concert venues they
just called it "big green button."  It is a button on a podium that
sends a wireless message to another computer that then does something
via a web API on the Internet, like taking a photo and uploading it to
Facebook.  Pretty simple code.
