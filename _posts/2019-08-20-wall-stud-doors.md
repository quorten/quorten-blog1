Sure, we know there is the standard wall stud spacing, but how far are
wall studs spaced apart around doorways?  Well, well, it turns out
that wall stud construction around doorways is a bit non-trivial, so
let's describe this with a picture, as well as the jargon used in the
profession.  Please note that these descriptions are specific to
U.S. construction standards.

* The dimensions of a "2x4" are 1.5 by 3.5 inches.  The dimensions of
  a "2x6" are 1.5 by 5.5 inches.

* Standard wall studs are typically 16 inches apart, except for some
  interior walls that might go 24 inches apart.

* Above and below wall studs are _wall plates_ that protrude into the
  finished indoor space and would otherwise block doorways.  Thus, you
  may need to cut away a wall plate that may interfere with the bottom
  of a door.

* Doorways are typically 30 to 31 inches wide.

* The studs immediately surrounding a doorway are _trimmer studs_.
  They are the height of the doorway.

* Immediately surrounding the trimmer studs are "king studs," which is
  just another name for standard height studs.

* The top-edge of the doorway is bordered with a _header_, which is
  two studs plus a 0.5 inch plywood, at least in the case of using 2x4
  studs.

* Between the header and the top wall plate are _cripple studs_, studs
  that are shorter than the full wall length.

* The finished edge of the doorway that holds the door closed is
  called the _door jamb_.

* The horizontal beams supporting the floor/ceiling are called
  _joists_.

Gosh, all this lingo, it really reminds you that in the old days,
people worked with this kind of physical construction a lot.  But once
additive manufacturing scales up, the vocabulary will, sadly, become
much more scarce.  I know, it always when our world becomes more high
tech and old professions die out.
