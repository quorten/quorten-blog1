Wow, this is interesting.  An ice cream truck that does not dispense
ice cream.  The driver of this truck, who takes it merely as an
occasional recreation, has gotten quite the number of interesting
reactions from people of all ages.

The Minnesota State Fair is canceled this year, they don't want to
ruin it by providing a bad experience with all the mitigations that
would have to be put in place for Coronavirus.  This wasn't the first
year it was canceled due to a public health outbreak.
