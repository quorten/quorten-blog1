Burgers... what does Wikipedia have to say?  Oh, some interesting
things.

White Castle was basically the first fast food restaurant, and in
order to supply their operations, they ended up creating many
supporting businesses.  Why "white" castle?  Because at the time, the
meat packing industry had a reputation for being unsanitary, and White
Castle's founders sought to change that reputation.  However, White
Castle did not grow to become as big as today's other fast food
restaurants because they were reluctant to loan money or to franchise.
All White Castle buildings are company-owned.

Ah, more interesting quotes here:

> The chain moved the restaurant to the corner of Central Avenue and
> Fourth Street Southeast. However, by this time the company had
> failed to notice the population shift from central cities to
> suburbs, and it spent more time trying to survive in urban
> neighborhoods instead of building larger buildings in the
> suburbs. The company eventually recognized the business potential of
> building larger restaurants in the suburbs. However this meant that
> the smaller, older castle buildings became obsolete.
