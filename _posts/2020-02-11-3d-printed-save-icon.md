Interesting meme going around.  I showed this floppy disk to a
youngster and they said "Oh, you 3D printed the save icon?"  At first
sight that I saw it, I thought it was a LinkedIn post from Bill Gates.
Nope, it's Bill Gross.  You should have known... that Bill Gates is
pretty pulled out of tech nowadays.

This is an interesting article about how Ikea is using 3D printing in
furniture to make it more accessible.
