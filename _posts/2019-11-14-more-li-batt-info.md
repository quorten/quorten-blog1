Lithium batteries are less likely to leak than alkaline batteries.
But what kind, specifically?  There's more than one type of Lithium
battery.

Specifically in the case of non-rechargeable batteries, there are two
main chemistry designations that are advantageous to use either for
their leak resistance, or when they do leak, their tendency to be
relatively non-corrosive.  The first and most common kind is the "CR"
chemistry designation, which is short for lithium manganese dioxide.
This is the most common type of chemistry used in 3 V button cell
batteries.  Reading the types of chemicals involved at glance, you can
see that there aren't any particularly corrosive liquid elements
involved.  All solid metals or gases.

The second kind of non-rechargeable chemistry is "lithium-iron,"
specifically lithium iron disulfide.  This is used primarily in 1.5 V
AA and AAA batteries.  Although sulfur can be used in nasty chemicals,
it is a generally non-reactive element that commonly appears in the
sulfide and sulfate form in nature.

----------

One kind of lithium battery to stay away from is lithium thionyl
chloride, because this uses a liquid cathode, and is therefore prone
to leaking when the outer casing gets corroded, which is likely to
happen due to the inclusion of chloride.  And, these batteries can
explode when shorted.  Alas, the 1/2 AA clock batteries in classic
Macintoshes use these as standard, so that is the first thing you want
to treat if the battery is no longer providing a useful voltage.
