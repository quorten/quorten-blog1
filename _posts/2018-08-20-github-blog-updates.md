Interesting visit to GitHub blog.

Very interesting here, the emphasis on learning how to program
"without learning dependency management."  I must admit, however, that
the premise is a precarious one.  So, if you're bundling these
in-built dependencies into a development environment, you're intending
to imply that the resulting project will be less portable?  What's
going to happen when the user doesn't account for the dependencies?
Is it really right to leave them outside of full understanding of the
fact that modern software undergoes a modern development process?

In my opinion, learning programming without learning dependency
management is perfectly fine if you target simple hardware systems,
rather than modern software systems, that doesn't quite appear to be
the intended emphasis here.

Now, this is interesting.  Using an actual button to deploy software.
But what's the catch here?  The button used is a pre-made Amazon AWS
IoT button, and to get it set up requires creating an Amazon account.
Yuck, but... you get the idea.  If you ask an average consumer, surely
they would think that process to be more simple than going through a
home server, or even their own laptop/PC.
