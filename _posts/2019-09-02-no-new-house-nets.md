Being asked the question of how to tell if a newly built house is
wired correctly for modern networking, I must admit that you should
simply assume it isn't correctly wired and you will redo it yourself.
Typically, they're building with modern cabling, Cat5 or better, but
the design intelligence lags behind.  Star topology and cable upgrades
are an oversight.  In other words, there's a skills gap that could be
solved if the necessary education is universal across all construction
teams.
