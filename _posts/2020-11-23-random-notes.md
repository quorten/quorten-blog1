A string of failed searches brought up some interesting results today.

Romance novels are the most popular fiction book genre ever?
Interesting.  But more interesting is the commentary that this is
probably one of the few art forms created by women, for women.  Well,
that being said, 20% of the readershsip is men, but many of these men
are highly secretive about their participation.  Half of all romance
novel readers are married.

DuckDuckGo why aren't more public domain books used in school

Yeah, there was that really big scare tactic to ban mention of
Christmas break from public schools, and then many were thinking this
meant you weren't allowed to talk about Christmas either.  Okay, fine,
working through the logic, it works like this.  The school is not
stating it is officially sanctioning a break for Christmas, it can
only officially say that there is a break because they decided so.
But that's not to say they can't indicate the existence of any
religious observance days on their calendar.  And, they can make legal
disclaimers if there are questions about it.  Even Bill Clinton issued
a memo to defend the validity of religous expression in schools.

<!-- more -->

The First Amendment allows for plenty of opportunity of religious
expression in schools so long as it is not coerced, and it can be
discussed as class material so long as it is not "proselytized" or,
conversely, denigrated.  But, even more important, there is now more
religious expression in schools today than there was in the past.

Another important note, after-school religious clubs are permitted at
public schools, since attendance is optional.

An interesting commantery comes on religious symbols.  These are
thought to be acceptable so long as their display is "temporary,"
especially when used as an instructional aid, but permanent display is
probably not acceptable.  Where to draw the line between temporary and
permanent is still in dispute.

But finally, one successful search.  What is the background of the
motto "In God We Trust" on currency?  Now, this is the interesting
story.  The motto was not originally on U.S. currency, but it really
came onto it, according to the U.S. Treasury, during the civil war and
the increased religious sentiment in the United States at the time.

Simply put, religious minister Rev. M. R. Watkinson wrote a letter to
the Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase asking for the
inclusion.  One question being raised, in reference to the longevity
of the nation should it survive into the future, was the strength for
which it stands.  Secretary Chase promptly agreed and wrote a letter
to director of the Mint James Pollock craft the design.  Finally,
since an existing law already fixed the design, the last step was to
have Congress approve the change in design, which they did.
