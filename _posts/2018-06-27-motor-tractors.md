Motor?  What does Wikipedia have to say about this?  A redirect to
"engine," the word was originally used to distinguish internal
combustion engines from steam engines.  This discussion is heavily
biased on vehicle motors.

Steamroller?  Indeed, early forms were indeed steam-powered.  The main
reason these became wildly popular was because they were more economic
than the horse-drawn alternatives.

The precursor of the tractor, the steam-powered traction engine.  Too
heavy to drive across ground as regularly as a modern tractor, so
compromises had to be made.  Most often used to power farm equipment
that would otherwise be manual.

Operating a steam tractor engine is a long ways away from the Dukes of
hazard speeding around in their 1950s...  no 1960s Dodge car?  Ah, a
customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car.

So yeah, the point is that the earlier motor vehicles were too
cumbersome and too slow for speeding to be a thing.  Only after the
motor vehicle has been made so easy and so convenient to operate does
speeding become a problem.

So, point in hand?  This is an example of the unintended consequences
of technological advancements.  And the technological fix proposed?
Make cars self-driving.  Beyond this, self-driving cars could made to
be able to drive really fast and be safe in conditions where humans
could not be... like speeding through an intersection.  Alas, that's
but more room for unintended consequences to creep in.
