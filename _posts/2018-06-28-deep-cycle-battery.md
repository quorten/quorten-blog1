Solar power notes.

So. what is a deep cycle battery?  A lead-acid battery that is
designed for deeper discharges, but that means to 50%, not to 0%.
Normally lead-acid batteries are used for car starters (well, at least
the vast majority still in use as of 2018) and do not go through such
deep cycles.
