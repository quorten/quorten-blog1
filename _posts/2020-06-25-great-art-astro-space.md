This is a great article recounting several astronauts specific words
about what they felt when they went up in space, what kind of mental
transformation happened when they saw the space-bound view of Earth.
Suddenly, they're home is Earth, not just one part of Earth, any
people in different countries that they've never even been to
neighbors and friends alike.  Aboard the International Space Station,
the experience is really transformative to be eating a meal with
astronauts from different countries, over the course of which the
Station flies over each one of their own countries so fast.
