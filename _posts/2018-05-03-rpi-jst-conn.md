Important!  Raspberry Pi notes.  So, the solution for your reusable
connection woes?  Use JST connectors for many components.  This will
ease a lot of things.

Oh, also you can make your own printed circuit boards if that will
help.

UPDATE 2019-12-04: I have decided that Molex PicoBlade is better
because it is more common and it doesn't lock so tightly that it is
difficult to remove.
