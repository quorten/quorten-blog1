So, with all the heyday of Microsoft software obsolescence... well,
unfortunately Microsoft is not completely obsolete.  Although we no
longer need the Microsoft Windows operating system in the home to get
typical home computing tasks done, apparently we still need Microsoft
Office for the occasional Office document that comes our way that uses
arcane features that the competing software solutions don't quite work
well enough with yet.

So, Microsoft Office is the old Windows-only thing (with the exception
of Mac OS X), OneDrive is the new thing.  So, how do you use OneDrive
on GNU/Linux.  Unfortunately, even that is not possible.  But, there
are third-party solutions that work somewhat well.  If you want to use
OneDrive on a fully modern computing platform, iOS and Android are
your choices for a mobile operating system.
