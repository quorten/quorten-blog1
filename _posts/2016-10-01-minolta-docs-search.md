I'm still searching for diagnostic pin doucmentation on my Minolta
camera, here is what I found.

At first, it looked promising, but at a careful look at the blurred
preview page images, it became clear that the actual PDF document
(that I could not download without first registering) was actually
something else that was fakely marked up as a Minolta camera service
manual.

* And I thought I was really close.  I thought I was really close to
  finding out what those 10 pins inside the film bay of the camera
  might do.  But nope, I wasn't.

But, anyways, I'm still interested.  What if a search for a "Minolta
Riva Zoom 115 EX Service & Repair Manual" actually did bring up the
correct result?  Anyways, I'll just have to keep remembering this one
to follow up for later.

These are some other useful links I've found in the present.  Note
that Manualsparadise.com is really the same as Manualzone.com, and I'm
not exactly sure about the trustworthiness of these sites as they
appear that they may be using keyword stuffing on constructed separate
domains to make them appear higher ranked in search engines.

Getmanual.com might be useful.

I might be revisiting this site.  Unfortunately, it does not have the
service manual for the Riva Zoom 115 EX.

What should the service manual look like, anyways?  For reference,
I've found this item on Ebay that includes an image.  For safety, I've
saved the image into the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.

This is an interesting web page that discusses camera repair.
However, it seems the focus is on SLR cameras rather than compact
cameras.  Sure, I understand, compact cameras are the kind of cameras
that people would rather throw away and buy a new one than try to
repair themselves.
