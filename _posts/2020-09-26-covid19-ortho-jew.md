Very interesting news here about heightened COVID-19 spread in
Orthodox Jewish communities in New York, mention of a serious lockdown
in Israel, and...  why are they so resistant to wearing masks?  They
want to cover the rest of their bodies with lots of clothes, hats
included, is wearing a mask really that bad for their style?
