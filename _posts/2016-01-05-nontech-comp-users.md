Non-technical people?  How do non-technical people use computers?  Oh,
here is their thought process.  They will do the least amount of
effort possible to see some cool picture or video, or they may spend
all their time on social networking software.  They will NOT make any
more attempts to try to get things to work any better on a technical
level.  Yeah, I know, it sounds stupid, but that's the way they are.

But, guess what the most interesting aspect about this behavior is?
They actually don't like their nature of this.  They want to be
better.  They see spending too much time watching TV as a bad habit.

If you were wondering why the patents over video compression codecs
are so political, it is due to the belief that there is a huge amount
of money to be tapped from the relevant sector.
