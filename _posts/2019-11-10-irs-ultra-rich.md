I've read this article a little while back, but apparently I didn't
save it.  It is a very interesting article about how the IRS tried to
take on the ultra-rich, it didn't go well.  Namely, the case of Georg
Schaeffler, "the billionare scion of a family-owned German" auto parts
manufacturer, who was working quietly as a corporate lawyer, until
some complications happened with the purchase of Continental AG that
nearly caused the him to loose it all.  A highly creative debt
restructuring came under the suspicion of the IRS as a tax evasion
strategy.
