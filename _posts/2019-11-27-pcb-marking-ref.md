Many PCB board markings are self-explanatory, R = resistor, C =
capacitor, D = diode.  But there are also many obscure PCB markings,
such as U = integrated circuit, L = inductor, Q = transistor.  That
being said, I found a StackExchange question with a good reference for
these marking abbreviations.

Also, it's something to keep in mind if you design your own printed
circuit boards, what markings you should use for the components on
your board.
