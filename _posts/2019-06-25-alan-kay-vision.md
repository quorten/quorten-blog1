I remember reading about Alan Kay in my AP Java computer science
textbook.  His vision was that every child would do computer
programming in object-oriented programming languages like Smalltalk.
Nowadays we know much better, that never panned out.  Nowadays, every
child does the typical consumer computing activities on computers,
computer programming not included.

Ah, so what does Wikipedia have to say about this failed visionary
insight?  Well, well, it has the clever Ray Kurzweil way of backing up
the vision with 20/20 hindsight.  Yeah, although modern children as of
2019 have never got around to computer programming, they have
successfully played around on tablet computers, just in line with Alan
Kay's vision of the Dynabook tablet-like computer device in
educational computing.  Modern non-technical early education school
teachers can easily push the tablets into their classroom, without the
need of a specialized computer teacher to drive anything inside the
classroom.  So these computers are in fact "educational" since they
are being used by schools.

Also, Alan Kay has similarly provided updated critique and details on
his own visions in light of these new facts.

To be fair, my statement that came out of my Java book could have
easily been a misinterpretation of Alan Kay's original vision.
