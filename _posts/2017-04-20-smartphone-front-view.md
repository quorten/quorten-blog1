* Smart phones need "front-view mirrors."  Seriously, that would
  greatly help prevent the problem of people with their heads down
  looking at their phones, walking forward at the same time, and
  almost running into you.  The human visual system simply isn't
  designed to see over the head.  That's very much a blind spot, and
  in fact, the bind spots where the optic nerves come together in a
  bundle in your retina are located at the top of you vision.

    * So why do people like to hold their mobile phones down in front
      of them with their arms?  Why not hold them forward where they
      can see where they are walking?  Well, we know the answer that
      to that.  "Remember the gorilla arm."  It is far more
      comfortable to hold your arms down low than it is to hold them
      up high.  So actually, when you see people walking around with
      their arms down and heads down at their smart phone, remember
      they are doing so because it feels more ergonomic.

   That being said, if someone wants good ergonomics and safety at the
   same time when walking on a mobile phone, one needs to use
   "front-view mirrors."  I personally wouldn't mind if I were
   approached by someone with a smart phone using front view mirrors,
   because I would be able to see their face through the front-view
   mirrors as they would be able to see mine, and it would be very
   clear from their walking navigational decisions whether they are
   actually trying to avoid walking into me or not.

* UPDATE 2019-11-21: Indeed this has become a thing with some
  smartphones.
