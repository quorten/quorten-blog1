Okay, my first experience using FreeCAD, I'll just run it on Raspberry
Pi 4 like I do any computer, right?  Wrong!  I install it, it starts
up okay, but then when I am about to open any 3D model, it crashes!
Why?  Well, apparently it had a long history of not working on any
Raspberry Pi version, but never fear, there is now a way to make it
work on Raspberry Pi 4.  You just have to... compile the latest
version of the package yourself.
