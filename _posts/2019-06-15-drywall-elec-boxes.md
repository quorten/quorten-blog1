So, there is a place where I want to add a new electrical box so I can
bring in a new Ethernet port.  Alas, I think this through, and is this
really possible what I want to do?  I've seen references in other
places to using drywall mounting screws instead when the wall is
already all finished off.

Well, let's see.  Indeed, there are quite different methodologies to
installing electrical boxes depending on whether your drywall is
already up or not.  If it is, there are _old work boxes_ that use a
special drywall clamping mechanism.  _New work boxes_ screw to a stud.
So, suffice it to say, you _can_ install an electrical box where there
is an existing finished wall, but doing so really isn't that much
different than using drywall mounting for the keystone jack face plate
only.
