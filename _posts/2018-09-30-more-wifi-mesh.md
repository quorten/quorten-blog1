Important!  So you know what you were saying about the problems with
mesh networking in a smaller space?  Well, it looks like despite the
large square foot recommendations, you can still do pretty well with
more access points in a smaller amount of space, especially if there
are more walls built up.  Just make sure to specifically buy models
that have smaller antennas and lower transmit power so that you'll
minimize the cellular interference issue.

Also noted is the advent of more "consumer friendly" wireless mesh
network systems.
