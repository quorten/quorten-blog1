Here is an interesting article on what we know about COVID-19 after
this much time into the pandemic.  The main thing I think is
interesting, COVID-19 isn't that strong of a virus.  Not just in terms
of the fact that it tends not to kill its host upon infection (and
hence its successful spread), but the fact that the virus, when
exposed to the environment, tends to get damaged and loose its viral
effectiveness quite easily.  Really, the only thing that enables its
spread is close human contact, especially breathing the same air from
another person.  And, of course, airplane transit of humans is what
facilitated its international spread.
