This is interesting.  Joel on Software created the blog article "the
law of leaky abstractions" a long time ago, and it is being felt still
today with problems in modern software.  "Failure does not respect
abstraction."  If a failure happens, it happens in spite of the
designed programmer abstractions.

Oh wow, this is great news!  The EOMA 68 is making it further along to
being manufactured for real!  Unfortunately, since I was not a
pre-order customer, I will not be able to have one, there are only
enough being made for the pre-order customers.
