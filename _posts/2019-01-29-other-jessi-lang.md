As is classic with Twitter, there is always more than one person that
you know who has the same name.  So, there is one person from Twitter
that I've been reading their tweets from Twitter that you may know of
as Jesse Lang, and sure enough, there is another Jesse Lang on
Twitter, more than one, matter of fact.  So, who is this other Jessi
Lang?  Sometimes I think of this other Jessi Lang as an "alter ego" of
the Jesse Lang I know.  The Jesse Lang I know likes to ride around a
motorcycle every once and a while.  This Jessi Lang, by contrast, is a
real "gearhead" car geek.

This Jessi Lang also experienced the extreme of a near fatal motor
vehicle collision.  I believe it happened on the German autoban, while
test-driving a prototype car at high speed and a lower speed car
careened out in front of them.  But wow!  Can those autoban accidents
be quite severe, where inexperienced and highly experienced drivers
may be sharing the same road.  No wonder why there are no autobans in
the United States like that.  Sactioned racetracks are definitely a
safer place to test-drive cars at high speed.
