Recently, I decided to revisit PetaPixel to look at one of the old
good articles that I've saved.  Along the way, I found some
interesting newer articles too.

This is unfortunate, DSLR cameras from photojournalists were becoming
a new favorite target among robbers in California.  That's hardly ever
a problem in general, as I understand it.

This is a really great article about the problem with camera backpacks
constantly being designed for "everyone" and "everything" as a
one-size-fits all.  With such an emphasis on mass marketing, it's hard
to sell more niche designs in smaller numbers, so they never really
come onto the market.

This is an interesting article discussing taking wedding photos to
save copies to two different SD cards and some of the counterpoints
presented by other photographers.

Cruise passenger banned for life for posing for dangerous photo?
Isn't that a little too extreme.  Well, in this case, with some
explanation, actually, no.  The passenger climbed over the railing to
take a photo, with high risk of falling to her death.  Recently, there
has been a rash of man overboard incidents in the cruise ship
industry, which cause massive delays and require lifeboats to be
deployed for a search crew "to look for the... well, usually it's a
body," as stated in one of the comments.  "They're clearly getting
quite fed up with anything that puts people in danger of going
overboard."

So, point in hand, in the worst case, the offending passenger never
comes back for business with the cruise company, so the cruise company
decided a similar punishment was fitting for this passenger.

This is a good video of a photographer reacting to bad photography
taken in some old reality television America's Next Top Model.  It's
worth taking a look for some good advice out of the critique,
particularly about photographing people.

Wow, German lenses are getting a 25%+ price hike as part of a new
tariff added due to Airbus getting illegal subsidies that compromised
competition for US-based Boeing.

Very interesting story of a lens that was lost in the wilderness,
exposed to the elements, then found once again, in perfect working
condition.  The only mark left on it was a discoloration on the widest
part of the barrel that was touching the ground.
