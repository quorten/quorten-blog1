So, how does polyester fabric recycling work?  Unfortunately, for the
time being, it is by far and large not practiced.

* Polyester production:
    * 60% clothing
    * 30% bottles

Therefore, most recycling must happen from the clothing.
Unfortunately, this is where collection infrastructure simply isn't in
place.  And when it is, the recycled fibers often times aren't of high
enough quality to be sold for general clothing, only "forgiving" uses
like winter wear.  That is, using the mainstay common mechanical
reycling method.  Chemical recycling is exceedingly rare.

Finally, the problem with non-biodegradable materials.  Human society
will always drop materials and let them run loose from the human
world.  Once they go drifting out in the natural world and never
biodegrade, that's where they can cause harm.  Or maybe they do
biodegrade and leak out poisonous substances into the environment,
which ends up in water supplies and right back to humans.

Also unfortunately, recycled material demand outstrips supply, mainly
due to lack of consumer focus on recycling, so some unscrupulous
suppliers will manufacture new bottles and ship them to the recycling
facility.  Yes, so as unfortunate as it is, even though we have the
material resources to supply manufacturers with a greater quantity of
recycle feedstock, it's not happening.  Perhaps the problem is greater
for plastic than it is for paper.

* Footnote: Unfortunately, this is the problem with recycling
  _anything_.  Collecting, getting the items to work with.  When those
  who have do not want to distribute them to the right places that can
  make the most use out of them.  It applies with information and data
  collection too: when one no longer care about information and wants
  to "throw it out", will they permit reuse of the information for
  other purposes?  Obviously, in the case of information, this is more
  of an intellectual phenomenon than a physical one, since it is quite
  likely that humans are totally incapable of destroying information:
  the fabric of the Universe always remembers.

    * The reality that people have to accept.  You cannot destroy
      information but you can make it more difficult to access.  So,
      what is your quantitative threshold of difficulty of access?
      Yes, in statistical terms.  Given that there is for certain one
      "exploit" that will happen in the distant future, thousands of
      years later, how many exploits on average are you okay with over
      what period of time?  Also, compared to the actual statistics of
      exploits from other methods.

      Also, let's be concise about the defining criteria.  If the
      actions have no effect on you, absolutely zero, then there is no
      reason to be upset.  Why?  Because the actions are
      imperceptible!

Now, carpet is a great source for recycled material, unfortunately
most of it gets thrown away rather than recycled proper, often times
due to lack of infrastructure.

So, all that being said.  For local recycling.  Does the Prusa i3
support a filament width sensor?  Indeed, it does, and there are some
people using it.
