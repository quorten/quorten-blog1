Oh, very interesting.  GitHub updated their terms and conditions to
make them more user-friendly, hence they are more practically
enforcable.

Oh, I didn't know there were special U.S. laws rendering complications
for web service operators when people under the age of 13 are
involved.  What is that law, anyways?  Oh, this.  Yep, definitely
written with a one-sided mindset.  And for GitHub's side, they don't
want anything to do with those more complicated legalese, especially
getting in trouble for not following them.  Indeed!  If you read their
terms and conditions, they don't say that users under 13 are
prohibited from using Internet services in general; they just say that
they do not _target_ their service to users under 13, and as a
convenient way to escape potential legal liability, they forbid such
users in their agreement, even though it is totally legally possible.

* Footnote: Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  But, the
  _really_ interesting thing about all such laws that pertain to
  people under 13 years of age.  In only a few years after any such
  legal dispute, the dispute will be irrelevant because the person in
  question will no longer be a member of the prohibited group.  And
  you know the way legal disputes are: one year is considered "fast."
  The 18 years of age laws have a little bit more legal wiggle room
  for disputes before they become obsolete.  Ultimately, we must all
  agree that none of these laws are really... are really all that
  enforceable, but are written upon the assumption that people will
  avoid disputes to begin with.
