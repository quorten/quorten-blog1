Okay, so now I got the idea that I could use a Digital Multimeter to
disambiguate which contacts inside of the camera correspond to what
pins on the servo motor control.  Is it in fact safe to use a Digital
Multimeter for continuity checks on integrated circuits?  According to
my findings, yet again on the very helpful Stack Exchange Electronics
site, I find that it indeed is.  So, use the diode test mode or the
continuity test mode.  I think we'd want to use the diode test mode,
as that has ought to be safe for semiconductor electronics, right?

Failed search.  More ambitious would be to find information on the
Internet on how to disambiguate the pins on a servo motor.  Alas, like
I said, failed search, I was unable to turn up any useful results.
