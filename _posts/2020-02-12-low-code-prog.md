Low code programming expected to be on the rise?  What is that?  Oh,
basically, it is like programming by clicking together GUI block
diagrams.  Yeah, it's not the most powerful form of programming, but
apparently it is becoming very popular in the business world where
skilled software developers are hard to find.

And, there's even "no code" development that boasts to be even easier
to use than low-code.  It's the kind of term that just makes you want
to think, "How do you program without code?"
