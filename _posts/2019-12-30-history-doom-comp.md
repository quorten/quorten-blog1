This is an interesting article on the history of graphics rendering
algorithm development in the Wolfenstein 3D and Doom game engines.

It was later republished on Ars Technica.  Please note, however, that
the only addition they made was some screenshots from the games.

So, about the original blog.  It's great to see that the purpose of
this blog article is to provide a computer history from a perspective
more relevant to that of the tech industry workers.

I also found a few interesting articles here.  The manpage article
distinctively makes no mention of Texinfo, though it would have been a
great illustrative example about why traditional Unix manpages are so
hard to displace.

There is a page on which articles were translated into different
languages by third parties.

But, by far the most interesting, the contents of Ada Lovelace's first
program.  It is a program to compute Bernoulli numbers, useful in the
computation of other numbers such as a sum of integers each raised to
the nth power.  The published copy did in fact have one bug, but it
may have been due to a typesetting error, introduced by a secondhand
human.  The overall published program was excellently documented and
specified, so translating it into modern programming languages like
Python and C was a breeze.
