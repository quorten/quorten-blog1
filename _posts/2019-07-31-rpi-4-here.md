Good, news, Raspberry Pi 4 is here, 9-12 months ahead of schedule!  It
is the much-awaited redesign from 40nm to 28nm silicon, and with it
boasts a boost in performance more similar to desktop PC levels.

Unfortunately, a notable caveat is that Raspberry Pi 4 does not
support network boot quite yet.  On the other hand, a great advantage
is that it's USB power port is USB on-the-go, so anything you can do
with a Raspberry Pi Zero, like "memory program" download a boot image,
you can also do with a Raspberry Pi 4.

How did I stumble upon this new knowledge?  Well, as you were just
reading in my previous blog articles, I was searching how to get the
serial number of a Raspberry Pi, and then I stumbled across the
Raspberry Pi license key generator, which noted that MPEG-2 license
keys will not work with Raspberry Pi 4 since it does not have the
necessary hardware.  Wait, what?  Raspberry Pi 4 is already out?
Indeed it is.

Yes, I know, I know, I was over a month late to the party, but I still
found out in a somewhat reasonable amount of time.
