XEmacs, ah, yes, the venerable Emacs fork that got ahead for a short
amount of time, but soon fell behind.  Last time I checked a couple of
years ago, I remember trying it out and deciding not to use it because
it looked laughably out-of-date.  What ever happened to it in recent
times?  Ah yes, the inevitable fate came to it: because it had fallen
too far behind GNU Emacs and there were too few developers left on
XEmacs, it was retired to maintenance mode indefinitely.  Essentially,
it's a clear way to state that XEmacs is slowly fading away, but
without immediately declaring its official end.
