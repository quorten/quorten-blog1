Wow, Brazil is in really deep trouble for its lackluster response to
Coronavirus.  The death toll there is reaching world records and its
showing no signs of slowing down.  Not to mention, being an
undeveloped economy and having a history of political turmoil over
economic downturns, things are looking really gruesome ahead.
