Well, well, I'd be.  Here it is, a marketing strategy recommendation

Why the heck did I read and write down that link?  Well, Firefox is
trying really hard to force this marketing and promotion upon us
through its "pocket" automatically generated constantly changing
article lists that show up.  And yes, if you set a homepage for
yourself, they will show you their own homepage every single time you
create a new blank tab.  Absolute highjacking for command and control.
