Interesting and unfortunate.  The Northern African white rhinoceros is
practically extinct, with only two living rhinos in captivity.
Political instability leading to illegal poaching was the cause of
this demise.  Whereas, the Southern African white rhinoceros fares
much better as it lives in a... well, slightly more politically stable
area.
