Nowadays, with the proliferation of tablets, smartphones, video
recording, social network, and television channels, surely the average
American no longer thinks that being on TV is special anymore,
correct?  Well, let's see what information we can find on this.

Failed search.

On, the other hand, I found this really interesting article on why 3D
TV is dead.  Why?  Well, the only reason why 3D TV was introduced was
due to the hit Avatar movie also being a hit 3D movie.  There were
also other technical issues too, such as the recent digital television
switchover decreasing the likelihood of purchasing a new television so
shortly after.

One of the biggest problems, however, in recent years is that the
newer standards, 4K and HDR, do not support 3D, despite HDR and higher
brightness televisions coming with improvements that would help 3D.
So, that makes it even harder for 3D to make a comeback.
Fundamentally, people are only interested in 3D on projector displays
due to the wide angle viewing afforded by the setup.  It's not very
interesting on a screen as a screen is more like looking through a
window.
