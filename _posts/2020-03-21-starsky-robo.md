This is an interesting article about the end of Starsky Robotics, an
autonomous trucking company, and a view into the challenges of doing
venture capital in that particular industry.  My summary:

* Trucking companies are not particularly tech-savvy when it comes to
  purchasing autonomous vehicles, therefore it makes more sense to run
  such a company as a trucking fleet business of its own.

* Venture capital tech investors are not very savvy when it comes to
  safety engineering, but proper safety engineering is critical when
  it comes down to making ground in the autonomous trucking industry.
  Too often venture capital tech investors are more compelled by new
  features, not safety improvements and statements of fact that the
  delivered features will statistically function most of the time, not
  just some of the time.

* Venture capital tech investors often times also don't see companies
  individually, but see the sector as a whole.  And when they feel the
  sector as a whole over-hyped, they will pull out of investing of all
  related companies, regardless of whether or not those particular
  companies were responsible for hyping.

* Technology doesn't follow a pure exponential growth curve, but
  rather a series of S-curves, where diminishing returns on old
  technologies become apparent.  What kept Moore's Law going was the
  ongoing discovery of successor technologies in tournament
  competition fashion that could continue the larger exponential
  growth trend.  But alas, many times in tech we can get stymied at
  the end of one curve and it can be quite a while before we find the
  next curve on the way forward.

* How close we are to autonomous vehicles in general greatly
  influences what kind of size of companies can make the final jump.
  When we are far, the difference between the biggest and smallest are
  negligible.  When we are close, the small push that the biggest can
  make compared to the smallest may be enough to get us there.
