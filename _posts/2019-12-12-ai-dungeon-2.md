Looking for a more advanced text-based adventure game that has a
better undersanding of natural language?  Take a look at AI Dungeon 2.
It uses artificial intelligence with a massive trained model database
and requires very powerful GPUs to run at an acceptable speed.  Also,
it's open-source, so you can build and run your own.
