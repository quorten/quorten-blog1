Over the course of some of my recent previous work for hire, I worked
with some technologies that I really didn't want to work with, and I
have cemented that viewpoint by refusing to write blog articles or
claim having any knowledge on those technologies.  But on second
thought, maybe I should take a different approach, where I might write
blog articles on those technologies anyways, just to have some proof
for myself of what I was doing during that time that otherwise looks
like it was wasted.  Well, it was wasted time in my opinion, so that
is correct... except for the fact that I did end up getting paid
during that time.  The point is, no matter how much I don't like the
technologies from a religious standpoint, the big picture doesn't add
up if I fail to write blog articles after having worked with the
technology.

So, the point in hand, simply put, is that in the end, I need or
organize and section off an area of my blog where it is clear that
although I do not endorse some particular technologies and that I do
not want to work with them again in the future, I have ultimately
ended up working with them.  So, what are the technology categories
that I have previously worked with but deliberately omitted adding the
corresponding information to my blog?

* Windows Server
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Windows PowerShell
* VMware ESXi and VMware vSphere
* Electric Commander and Electric Flow
* Splunk
* Other yucky proprietary stuff like that

<!-- more -->

Now, I've also made mention of perhaps another good point.  Almost
none of my previous tech blog articles cover the related subject of
cash flow for performing the stated activities, they almost entirely
focus on the "how to" subject and the real world end effects of
performing the activity.  For the sake of my tech blog world, that was
largely the goal: the primary goal was to cover tech subjects that are
accessible to _anyone_.  Projects that work with free, libre, and
open-source software, projects that do not require an expensive bill
of materials, projects that can be done without access to a commercial
employer's proprietary environment or the ability to be legally
eligible for work so as to be hired for working in such an
environment, and ultimately, projects that are non-political, yes,
that was all part of the goal.

Indeed, it can be intuitively understood that being skilled in these
non-political activities is important to everyone, whether they are
titled as a paid professional or not.  Ultimately, it is the true
means that we get work done.  You can't do photographic work if you
don't functional optics, but the question of whether or not you get
paid for that activity is beyond the scope of the first-level
technical discussion.

So, looking forward to future blog articles, what additional
information can I state related to the point in hand given of missing
information?

1. What is the safety criticality of performing this task?  Are
   mistakes when performing this task fairly inconsequential, or will
   mistakes result in personal injury?

2. What is the "attention economy" required to perform this task?  Is
   this task impossible to perform correctly without a high state of
   alertness, attention, and a work environment free from
   interruptions and distractions?  Naturally, tasks with a high
   safety criticality will require a high attention economy.

3. What is the short-term net cash flow on performing this activity?

4. Are there existing political regiments that must be satisfied to
   perform this activity?  Define politics.  Politics is _who gets
   what, when, and how_.

5. What are the political effects of performing this activity?  The
   utmost minimal political effects of an activity is _n = 1_: _you_
   are the only person affected by performing an activity.

6. Only applicable if this activity does exist within a political
   climate.  What are the moral and ethical implications of performing
   this activity?

Also related, what are some important key points that some of my
previous blog articles do a good job on answering?

* What material, hardware, software, or technical resources are
  required for performing this activity?

* What time commitment is required for performing this activity?

* What is the total cost of the bill of materials?

* What is the required prerequisite technical knowledge for performing
  this activity?

* What are the real-world results of performing this activity?

* How does performing this activity contribute to long-term research
  and development efforts that will eventually result in future
  monetary savings, labor savings, and overall strategic gain?

One thing that I do want to point out in general.  In my blog, and to
some extent I can say this about myself overall personally, I am very
highly focused on economic advantages in terms of _long-term future
gains_ as the result of _research and development_.  However, I do not
say very much about short-term gains, .

----------

I must put my own opinion forward at this point, though.  The primary
problem with activities that have a larger political effect is that
they are often not reproducible: they have too many external
dependencies that have to be just right in order for conditions to
replay a second time as they have played out the first time.
Typically, for highly political events, we honestly cannot say that
they can be verified by any empirical scientific method simply because
of their lack of reproducibility.  Highly non-political activities, by
contrast, are a boon to the empirical scientific method because it is
often times fairly easy to control all pertinent variables so as to
reproduce the satisfying conditions exactly.

For this reason, you could argue that the term "political science" is
an oxymoron because there is no such thing as empirical scientific
study on a subject as uncontrollable as the world of politics.  The
history of politics might just as well be considered equal to the
history of UFOs, except for the study of reasonably small communities
of humans where the political dynamics can be reproduced with a fairly
high accuracy.
