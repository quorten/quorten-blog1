Wow, Libre RISC-V M-Class is making exciting progress.  A number of
processor architectural innovations are coming out of the project, and
admittably direct working in that area is a little bit above me, with
me mostly focusing on rather simple CPU designs for my own projects.
But, good news, if you'd like to contribute in some meaningful way but
are not able to directly participate in the tech discussion, there is
an NLnet funding grant for this project that is open to additional
donations.  Head on over to the corresponding NLnet site to donate.
