Looking for information on flexible glass?  Don't be fooled, a first
search on Wikipedia brings you to some interesting stories.  Suffice
it to say, the state-of-the-art of modern flexible glass technology is
that of Gorilla Glass and Willow Glass, both manufactured by Corning
Glass Company.

Beyond that, we have some pretty interesting information on Wikipedia
about lost technologies and ancient technologies.  A flexible
glass-like material was purportedly invented in the ancient Roman
times, but the inventor was beheaded out of fear, or so the legend
goes.  Other interesting lost inventions are Greek fire (some
nitrocellulose-like substance that can burn even on water),
corrosion-resistant iron, and precisely cut and drilled Mayan stones.
One interesting ancient inventions that I was previously unaware of
was Roman central heating systems.  Indeed, the implementation was
primitive, that of venting smokey furnace air underneath floors,
through chimneys inside walls, and out through a roof, with some brass
dampers in the system, but quite mighty in terms of the effectiveness
and capabilities of the time.

Another interesting area are those of pseudoscience and
pseudoarchaeology.  One modern work of art, the "Babylonokia"
represents a 1990s mobile phone handset carved out of a clay tablet
with Cuneiform markings on it.  This picture was copied and circulated
with some false claims of archaeological discovery.
