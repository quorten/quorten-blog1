What is the temperature of a burning match?  600 to 800 degrees
Celsius.  How does this relate with other hot temperatures?
Temperatures given are approximate for simplicity.

* 0100 C : Boiling water, limit of non-pressurized cooking
* 0120 C : Melting point of low-temperature hot glue
* 0200 C : Baking with browning effects, spontaneous combustion of
  paper and wood, melting point and glass transition temperature of
  most plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP, PMMA, PLA, ABS, PC), melting point of
  high temperature hot glue, melting point of leaded solder
* 0260 C : Lead-free reflow soldering oven, melting point of PS, PET,
  PVC plastic
* 0400 C : Lead-free soldering iron, melting point of lead
* 0600 C : Minimum match and candle temperature
* 0660 C : Melting point of aluminum
* 0800 C : Maximum match temperature
* 1000 C : Melting point of silver, gold, and copper
* 1400 C : Maximum candle temperature, minimum melting point of glass
* 1550 C : Bunsen burner temperature, maximum melting point of glass,
  melting point of iron, decomposition of carbon-fiber reinforced
  epoxy
* 2500 C : Thermite reaction temperature range
