What is the temperature of a burning match?  600 to 800 degrees
Celsius.  How does this relate with other hot temperatures?
Temperatures given are approximate for simplicity.

* 0100 C : Boiling water, limit of non-pressurized cooking
* 0200 C : Baking with browning effects, reflow soldering oven,
  spontaneous combustion of paper and wood
* 0400 C : Lead-free soldering iron, melting point of lead
* 0600 C : Minimum match and candle temperature
* 0800 C : Maximum match temperature
* 1000 C : Melting point of silver, gold, and copper
* 1400 C : Maximum candle temperature
* 1550 C : Bunsen burner temperature, melting point of iron
