Oh, interesting, from a failed search for a different topic, I found
this.  With data from the analysis of the spatial layout of a room,
you can 3D print the shape of an optimal reflector disk and cover that
witn aluminum foil to improve Wi-Fi reception.  This is cheaper than
buying a directional Wi-Fi antenna.

Failed search.
