What does an interplanetary spaceport look like?  Alas, searching for
that doesn't have very much useful in the way of the results.  Okay,
let's try another take on the subject.  Let's look at the biggest
international mass passenger transit systems operating in the world
today: airports.  Naturally, an interplanetary spaceport geared at
carrying mainly human passengers would look quite similar to a
scaled-up airport.

And the result?  Well, the biggest airport in the world,
Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport, looks quite
uninteresting from the aerial view.  Mainly, it's open space and
runways.  It's inside the smaller buildings where all the passenger
logistical routing magic happens.

Automated people mover?  Interesting name assigned to small autonomous
trains, typically deployed at airports and cities too small to justify
the expense and scale of a human-operated train.

So, being the Atlanta airport in Georgia is the world's largest
airport, what does Wikipedia have to say about the economy of Georgia?
Indeed, one of the big ticket items in its economy is that big
airport.  Also, Georgia being a ocean-side state, has the Port of
Savanah seaport, one of the largest container ports in the world, and
excellent connections to rail and Interstate freeways.
