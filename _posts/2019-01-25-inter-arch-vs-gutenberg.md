So, yeah I knew for some time that there is Project Gutenberg, Google
Books, the Internet Archive, those distributed library database
projects from Cornell, and so on... but what sense of continuity
between those distinct collections is there?  Where is the
collaboration and communication between them?  What is their official
stance on each other?  Yeah, for Google, we know the official stance
is clear... to have a digital book collection owned by Google.  As the
others are nonprofits, the situation of lack of communication and
collaboration is less clear.  Alas, it may be that they are suffering
just the same thing that we observe to be happening with libre
software projects... parallel projects working toward the same goal,
but alas with incompatible symbolic ways of doing so.

Wikipedia itself is not much more helpful in providing a stance
either.  Just a "list of similar projects."
