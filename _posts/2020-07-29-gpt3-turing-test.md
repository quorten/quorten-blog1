This is an interesting article, analyzing GPT-3 against a Turing Test.
It does quite well, and proves hard to beat.  One thing that is
obvious is that the intelligence is very capable in general, but its
range of responses to the Q & A test is over-constrained by the
example prompt, causing it to fail at some challenges that it can
easily pass when given a different prompt.

That being said, a few obvious and undeniable weaknesses are worth
pointing out.  Very straightforward, rational, quantitative, and
logical reasoning questions cannot be accurately answered.  For
example, answering questions about the relative weight of objects, it
does well most of the time but it has a few notable failures.  And,
performing arithmetic and simple list manipulations, the AI totally
falls on its face when prompted with this.  On the other hand, the AI
shows that it is curiously good at converting English descriptions of
computations to Ruby and Python programs that go and do likewise.

So, that being said, let me put in my own reflection.  Unfortunately,
the state-of-the-art of artificial intelligence has become a precise
mirror of our own human weaknesses.  Humans, on the mass market
general average, are excellent at generating entertainment materials
like fiction novels and "fake news," but they suffer greatly when it
comes to more precise, quantified, organized tasks.  Why?  It's simply
due to a lack of motivation.  Humans don't _want_ to do quantitative
reasoning.  It's not that they can't do it, it's that they don't want
to do it.

Interestingly, the very basic element of quantitative reasoning
doesn't really require good math reasoning skills.  It's merely a
matter of being able to always think about assigning a number to what
you are doing, to count up what you are doing, to label it, and
organize it into categories.  But alas, this is what your average
human resists so greatly.  By simply avoiding this type of practice
like an expert procrastinator, they effectively never practice the
skill, and by simply not practicing the skill, they can act like they
are artificially poor performers at a skill which honestly, from an
intellectual standpoint, is a easy skill for humans master.  What it
all comes down to is not forming the required habit.
