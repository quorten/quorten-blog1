How do you spell "guerrilla"?  Oh, just like that after looking it up
in a spelling dictionary.  Of course, it wouldn't be interesting if I
didn't also make sure to look it up on Wikipedia too.

Oh, now this is an interesting concept from guerrilla marketing:
"reverse graffiti": find a dirty surface, and wash away the dirt and
grime to make your perfect marketing image.  It's completely harmless,
and if anyone doesn't like the marketing image, they can simply wash
away the remainder of the dirt and grime from the surface.
