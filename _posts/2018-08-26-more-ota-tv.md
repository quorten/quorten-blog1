Okay, so more about the idea of having a single high-quality broadcast
television antenna and sharing it out across the computer network.  It
is feasible, but of course with limits: such devices are coined as
_multi-tuner_, the limit of course being the number of tuners that the
device has.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Also, keep in mind
that the average entertainment-focused consumer does not care to setup
these devices due to the fact that it requires "more technical skill."
So, for sure this is a minority idea for techies only.

So there are multi-tuner devices out there for over-the-air (OTA)
broadcast television.  So far the largest number of tuners in such a
device I read are 4.  In practice, such devices tend to be embedded in
a DVR that uses an interactive electronic program guide as a means to
select which programs to record.  Particularly noteworthy is that the
modern interactive electronic program guides typically come as a
subscription service with a monthly fee.  Also, note that you can get
some multi-tuner boxes separately from a purpose-built DVR, as is the
case with HDHomeRun.

Oh, and apparently TiVo was in fact the first DVR.

Okay, so let me summarize modern TV viewer habits, terminology, and
technology in a nutshell.

* Broadcast input: Choose one or more of the following:

    * Antenna, for terrestrial broadcast
    * Satellite dish, for satellite TV
    * Cable TV modem, for cable TV

* Tuner: Get as many of these as you can so that you can
  simultaneously record as many channels as possible.

* DVR: Get one of these so that you can simultaneously record multiple
  channels and then time-shift, place-shift, and format-shift to your
  viewing preferences.  The main point of this box is to have as many
  feature and functions as possible to compensate for all the
  inconveniences of the broadcast media.

* Automatic commercial skip?  Yes please!

* Interactive electronic program guide: Get a subscription to one of
  these so that you don't need to learn how to program timed recording
  into your DVR.

* Streaming device: Get one of these for each TV screen you have, so
  that each screen can connect with the DVR.  Your TV might have
  included an integrated "streaming device" if it is one of the newer
  models, but the general rule of thumb that has been observed over
  the decades is that the integrated tuner or streaming device becomes
  obsolete much faster than the screen itself.  A purpose-built
  streaming device, by contrast, is much easier to buy, replace, and
  dispose of as the latest television technologies come and go.

  If, by contrast, you are a "TV tech junkie," you could easily eschew
  the dedicated streaming devices as you'll be buying new TVs much
  faster than the integrated streaming capabilities become obsolete.

  Generally speaking, streaming devices are not required for computers
  such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, but some DVRs may require
  additional devices and fees to enable streaming to computer devices,
  or streaming to a destination on the Internet, not on the local area
  network.

* Infrared blaster: Get one of these so that you can use the old
  infrared TV remote to control your streaming device, rather than
  needing to use a separate remote for the streaming device.

* Parental controls: Although parental controls are wildly popular as
  of 2018, this is mainly due to a short-term culture shift.  It's
  clear that from the standpoint of people who are considered
  "children" in the year 2018, our modern technology has had very
  little influence over human culture of times past: the _culture_ of
  parental control is the main influence, and this is true
  irrespective of the technological means to that end.  Put another
  way, removing parental controls from modern devices would have no
  significant impact on modern children, positive or negative.

  The "V-Chip" was an early purpose-built hardware contender for
  parental controls before the advent of modern DVRs.

* Internet TV: Alternative to broadcast TV.  Provides video-on-demand,
  no need for antennas, dishes, modems, tuners, DVRs, automatic
  commercial skip, interactive electronic program guides, and infrared
  blasters.  However, parental controls are still "sold separately"
  from Internet TV.

* Television white-space Internet: Television traditionally had
  bandwidth reserved between channels because the old-fashioned analog
  broadcast circuitry was a bit imprecise and would otherwise
  interfere with neighboring channels.  Modern digital television
  broadcast circuits no longer have this problem.  Therefore, this
  old, unused white space between television channels can be used for
  two-way wireless communications for Internet.  This is not available
  in all jurisdictions, but where it is available, modern TV has come
  full-circle when television white-space Internet is used in
  conjunction with Internet TV.

Now, here are some more detailed points on modern TV viewer habits:

* Only real "TV junkies" will buy that much equipment mentioned above
  so that they can watch TV at "maximum convenience."  All other
  "part-time" TV watchers will consider the full complexity of
  technological devices mentioned above too much of a hassle to setup,
  and will instead opt for Internet TV if they want to watch TV
  part-time, at their leisure and convenience.

* Broadcast TV is no longer useful for instructional material.  Then
  again, you could argue that the phenomenon of broadcast educational
  material was specific to TV and wasn't really available on the
  earlier radio technology.

* In the modern era, news and entertainment are the primary mainstays
  of broadcast television.  This also applies with broadcast radio.

* In the modern era, educational material is almost exclusively
  received over Internet-connected devices.

* Internet connections can also be used to deliver news and
  entertainment that is available from radio and television.

Some jurisdictions place a tax on private copy media for revenue to
the entertainment industry, even though the vast majority of such
media is used in the computing industry for non-entertainment work.

Parental controls are very popular in the modern era, but
traditionalists worry that the control leveraged by modern parental
controls has gone too far.

Also, indeed, in case there is any question, ATSC in the United States
still does use some VHF band transmissions.  The total band space
spcified that it might use: VHF, UHF, and SHF.

ATSC 3.0 brings 4K broadcast TV, so we are told.
