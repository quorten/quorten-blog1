As a curiosity, I was wondering, how are seniors handling 2020?  Like,
emotionally, do they think they're making it?  And well, I've got a
bunch of interesting info.

First of all, they felt very well at the first stages of pandemic
quarantine.  Like, we're all in this together.  But at the same time,
may of them were not taking as many precautions as they should have.
But, it is the later stages that really gets them.  When quarantine is
being gradually lifted, they're seeing younger citizens enjoy
in-persosn socialization while they still have to be in quarantine,
and they worry that they will be cast out of society in a way.

But, this article, it is the most interesting, it really makes no
mention of the pandemic but focuses on the big picture from a
marketing standpoint in general, before and after the pandemic.  How
do seniors spend their time online, and how much?  Of those seniors
who do spend time online, they tend to be highly educated, theyspend
the most time online of all demographics, and they are extensive
participants in the more "serious" online activiies of eCommerce and
investing.  By comparison, younger online users primarily use the
Internet for entertainment.  And no, they don't want to pay for their
entertainment either.

So, if you're looking for a tech investor, highly educated seniors are
good candidates who would be willing.
