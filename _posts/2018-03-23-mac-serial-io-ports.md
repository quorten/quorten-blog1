Oh, interesting.  GeoPort.  Connect to phone lines without a modem, a
great feature on early Macintosh computers that outperformed PC
softmodems.

* Important!  Again, I reiterate, because this is important!
  Wikipedia said that the serial ports on the Macintosh can actually
  be put into either RS-232 or RS-422 mode.  You don't _need_ the
  special cable convert to go from RS-422 to RS-232.

    * CLARIFICATION: This came from the Wikipedia article and is
      actually misinformation.  The only conversion that happens is
      that through the use of specialized cables.  See the following
      information sources for more information.

This page provides very comprehensive information on interfacing
Macintosh serial ports with commodity PC hardware, including wiring a
LaserWriter to a PC serial port.

Some online cables that I could buy?  Given the previous sources,
better double-check them manually before plugging them in.  Oh, fine,
the old fashioned computer usage style.

Lesson learned: **DO NOT** follow incorrect information on the Internet!
It is RS-422, and it needs to be converted to RS-232.

  serial port modes

This is a very interesting page with lots of information on the
history of Apple computer connectors.  Not entirely correct on the
serial port part, though.
