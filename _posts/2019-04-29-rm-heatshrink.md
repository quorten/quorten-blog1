So, I've bought a serial cable that I knew was wired up wrong, with
the intent that I'll need to rewire it for it to work correctly.  I
open up the box on the RS-232 connector and I see that there is
heatshrink tubing over the soldered connections.  So, how do I remove
this?  Easy, just use a razor blade to cut away at the tubing, it is
designed to be very soft and pliable to the razor blade, then pull it
away with a pliers, tweezers, or whatever other simple tool works best
for you.
