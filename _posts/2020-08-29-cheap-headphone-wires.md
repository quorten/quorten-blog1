Wow, really interesting article here.  How are those headphone wires
so cheap and thin?  The answer, they use enamel-coated wire instead of
standard insulation around the wiring.  That also makes them more
prone to breaking, of course.  This article goes through what needs to
be done to repair such wires should you dare solder them yourself to
repair.
