Public Domain Day?  Ah, now that is interesting, I didn't know there
was such a celebration.  Public Domain Day in the United States is
January 1st, and it marks the first day that previously copyrighted
works officially legally cede into the public domain.  Public Domain
Day 2019 was a particularly notable day, with one of the largest
public domain releases in about 20 years, due to finally reaching the
end of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended the
copyright of works published before 1978 to a total of 95 years.  Now,
95 years after 1923, we have a whole new swath of public domain works,
ripe fruit to be used by creatives of the modern era.
