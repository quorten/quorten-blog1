This is a very interesting article about how mutations in the
Coronavirus can be used to track its generational count and also what
kinds of paths it may have taken for the disease transmission.  Virus
duplication is a sloppy and hasty process that produces errors.  It
turns out that the mass infections in New York have largely started
coming from Europe, where travel was unrestricted, and also there was
a cross-country source from Washington state.

This is a very insightful article about how Coronavirus can spread
quite prolifically through social activities, and the corresponding
importance of social distancing.  Someone who only has mild symptoms
and continues to be a prolific socialite can transmit the disease to
others who it is fatal to.
