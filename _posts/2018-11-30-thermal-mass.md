Now, I've heard of thermal mass before, most memorably in relation to
cold weather shooting with a DSLR camera, but what does Wikipedia have
to say about this?  I haven't read about it in detail.  Oh, wow, quite
a number of interesting things.  So, thermal mass is also termed
**thermal capacitance**.  Insulation inhibits _thermal conductivity_.
Thermal mass is great for isolating a building from fluctuating
external temperatures.  Concrete and earth are great sources for
thermal mass.  Therefore, an insulated concrete slab at the base of a
building can significantly improve its thermal efficiency and
dynamics.  Water, of course, is another great source for thermal mass,
since it has a very high specific heat.  That being said, the human
occupants of a building are also a great contributor to a building's
thermal mass.
