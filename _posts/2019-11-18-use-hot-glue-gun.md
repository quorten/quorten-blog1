Use a soldering iron to weld separate 3D printed plastic parts or as a
cheap replacement for a hot air gun for shrinking heat shrink tubing?
Na!  A soldering iron is generally too hot for those uses: Unless you
have a wide range of temperature control, a 370 degree Celsius
soldering iron runs the risk of burning plastic and heat shrink
tubing.  Instead, you can use a low-temperature hot glue gun, this
will run at 120 degrees Celsius and therefore will be withih the
temperature range of heat shrink tubing.  A standard temperature hot
glue gun is within the range of 200 degrees C, and therefore can be
used to weld plastic together.

On the other hand, if you want to be more daring, you could use a
small fan and a soldering iron to form a small makeshift heat gun that
would probably be within the temperature range of heat shrink tubing.
