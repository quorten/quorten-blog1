Is it possible to connect a classic Macintosh to the Windows SMB
network?  Yes, but keep in mind the particular vintages of Macintosh
under which this is possible.  Obviously, support is skewed toward
1990s-era Macintoshes, typically those with the PowerPC processors,
CD-ROM drives, color monitors, and so on.  Connecting a black and
white Macintosh to the Windows network may be much more tough luck.
