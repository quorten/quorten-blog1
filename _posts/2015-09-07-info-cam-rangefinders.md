Some interesting discoveries on cameras, rangefinders, and the like.

An interesting walkthrough of a 3D scan and print using proprietary
software from around the year 2002 or so.  It's interesting that
although the technology has been around for so long, it's still to
obscure and expensive to be practical on the mass market.

Yeah, interesting, but 96 DPI web resolution photographs fail to
provide the reader with enough detail in the image.  Wow, keep this in
mind when making recommendations on the inventory system technologies.
The problem with low resolution photographs is that the resolution is
never high enough, and the problem with 2D photography is that the 2D
photographs are never taken from enough angles.  And the problem with
black and white photographs is that the colors aren't accurately
depicted.  But it's still better than no photograph at all, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right.  That being said, that's the current
limitations of the technology you're working with.

And the problem with advanced photography is that the photographer is
too impatient to wait for slow imaging mechanisms (like 3D scanners)
to complete their scan.  They just want to push the button and call it
done!  Well, that's going to be an ongoing problem, then.  As we all
know, the way the human brain constructs 3D representations of objects
is not in one sitting, but by repeated exposures to the same object,
additional details on the 3D model are filled in, until one who has
used an particular 3D object many many times has a perfectly accurate
3D representation of the object in question inside their brain.  That
being said, the workflow for computer detailing of objects should
follow a similar process.  Give a quick and dirty process to the
infrequent objects, but let the frequent objects get fine grained
treatment.

How long the artist spends.  How much money you pay the artist to
perform a certain job.
