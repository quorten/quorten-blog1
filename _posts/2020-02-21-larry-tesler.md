Oh, interesting.  Larry Tesler was mentioned quite a number of times
in relation to cut & paste back in the earlier days of the Macintosh.
Unusually, through my light experience in classic Macintosh
programming, I have not seen his name mentioned in the documentation I
was reading, though others have back in the heyday.
