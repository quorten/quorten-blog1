Okay, so now I'm wondering why my GitHub pages don't get indexed by
search engines by Google.  Why?  Well, let's see.  Now this is
interesting.  The project pages are getting indexed okay, but the
direct domains, no.

So, that's just the thing.  Solve the annoyance I was experiencing!
Put a link to the site domain from within the project page, and that
should solve my indexing problems.  Although, it would be nice if
GitHub could do this for us.  Well, I guess it's more general and
works better for larger sites that require more customization.

Intersting news for GitHub pages, HTTPS for custom domains.  The thing
is that that *.github.io domains supported HTTPS for a long time, but
not custom ones.  Now custom ones support this too.
