KEH Camera, that's a new name to me, but it's where I bought my
replacement used Pentax AF200T flash box.  Sure they pride themselves
in being mainly an online store, but where are they located in?
Georgia, oh okay, that's a great location to be in for international
shipping.

Interesting blog article about spending more on a camera body versus
spending more on a lens.  If you're a skilled photographer, spending
more on a DSLR camera body can pay off, but less skilled photographers
are generally recommended to go cheap on the body and expensive on the
lens.  For film, cheap camera bodies can perform fine in terms of
quality, really it comes down to skilled use of the lens and the film
type.

Wow, so this is a really interesting blog article about the
differences in modern kit lenses compared to the old standard, "nifty
fifty" as the author calls it.  50mm prime lenses with a wide maximum
aperture were previously very popular kit lenses to include by the
manufacturer, but now zoom lenses come as a standard.  I agree this is
a big disappointment, being able to have excellent image quality in
low-light conditions and great depth-of-field?  Those are the classic
highlights of using SLR camera lenses, and it';s unfortunate that the
manufacturers are preferring to include zoom lenses.

Unfortunately, looks like the culture working at KEH Camera isn't all
that great.  Sure there's always negative reviewers, but I would
concede that this is more negative reviews than typical.

National Camera Exchange didn't have the equipment that I needed, so I
couldn't buy from them.  But, what about the effect of the COVID-19
pandemic on them?  They got hit really hard.  They previously had four
locations: Burnsville, Golden Valley, Edina, and Roseville.  Now
they're down to only their central Golden Valley location.  Their
Roseville location was the last to close.

Here is their page with updates for COVID-19 changes.  Lens rentals,
also permanently closed.  What effect does this have on teh lens
rental industry?  Looks like overall they're doing well, that was just
a National Camera Exchange decision to end lens rentals.
