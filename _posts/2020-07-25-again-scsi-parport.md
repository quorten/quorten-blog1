I already beaten this topic down many times, but I must revisit it one
more time.  SCSI over parallel port?  Sure, I know, it's not possible
since parallel port communications doesn't have enough of the right
type of I/O bits to carry SCSI communications, though the physical
connector has enough pins.  Matter of fact, classic Macintosh
computers use a DB-25 connector for SCSI.

The interesting thing though is that some vendor hardware was designed
to be dual-mode, either parallel port or SCSI port mode.
