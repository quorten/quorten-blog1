So, I'm wondering about using solid-ink printers for photographs?  Do
they produce great results?  Well, unfortunately as it turns out,
inkjet printers can still produce yet better results than solid-ink
printers.  Yes, solid-ink printers can produce very great results are
are water-resistant, but the very light colors will print poorly due
to the need to dither.

Also, what you need to know about the new Pentax K-1 Mark II.  As it
turns out, this is a really unfortunate bummer.  Yes, earlier I've
mentioned the battery life is not as good, but what makes this worse
is that the new processor put in for noise reduction cannot be
disabled.  Therefore, the high ISO photos are noticeably worse when.
Also, that new dynamic pixel-shift resolution mode that can be
operated hand-held?  Well, that doesn't produce convincing results
either.  Finally, as it turns out, the way to get better results with
any camera, yes, even the original Pentax K-1, is to shoot 4 photos
hand-held and then combine them in your favorite photo editing
software.  Photoshop has been tested to work well with the procedure.

So, yes, to reiterate my previous verdict: the Pentax K-1 Mark II
upgrade is not worth it.  Keep your original K-1 camera in
circulation.
