Okay, sure, so this Liberty Packaging company, yeah they're near to me
and a local name and all that.  But maybe I shouldn't have that bias,
maybe I should search the Internet and simply see who is the best when
it comes to selling custom boxes.  So I do...  and fortunately it
turns out that the best name is actually quite near to me to, right in
Minnesota.  Oh, wow.  Custom Boxes Now is their name.

They have everything I need, it's just not all available from their
custom box builder on their website.  Still, it's a useful tool for
getting a quote.  And, they also allow you to order in quantity of
one, and you can ship via FedEx.  That's all very great.

Bleach white box on outside, kraft brown on inside?  Got it.  Digital
printing without offset plate preparation?  Got it.  Two-color
printing?  Got it.  Laminated printing?  Got it too.

I checked two other comapnies, Great Northern Corporation (GNC) and
Packaging Corporation of America (PCA) but I'd reckon that Liberty
Packaging and Custom Boxes Now are both better choices.

Oh, and finally!  The answer to the size limit number on the box
certificate.  This size limit is **not** the actual size limit of the
particular box, but it is printed based off of the limit that the
particular corrugated cardboard material is capable of supporting.
That is, if you build a box with dimensions that are smaller than the
rated size limit, your product will be just fine, but if you use the
same material and build a box bigger than the rated size limit, the
box will not provide adequate strength for your product.  In that
case, you need to switch to a different type of corrugated cardboard
that is rated with a higher size limit in the box certificate.

Really, this interpretation also comes down to mailing requirements
made on boxes.  The box certificate must be printed as it is an
integral part of making insurance claims on damaged packages.  The
shipper will check the box certificate's specifications with their own
requirements to verify the box was built to a specification that they
insure.  This is where the interpretation of size limit and weight
limit being the upper limits that they are come into play.

Oh yes, and of course, to top off the shipping process, DIM weight is
used for the billing of lightweight packages.
