Lots of interesting bike gadgets mentioned here, except for one.  Not
appropriate for Americans, though Europeans might think differently.

So, what's the lowdown on a summary of these gadgets?

* Lights, lights, lots of lights.  Standard LED headlight and
  tail-light, laser icon projector lights, laser lane marker lights,
  360 degree lights, green bottom glow light, handle bar turn signals,
  signal gloves, backpack brake and signal lights, seat post
  tail-light, smart multi-tool headlights, shoe safety lights, video
  display wheel lights, wheel glow lights, lighted vests.

* Reflectors: 360 reflective vest, reflective paint, reflective socks.

* Horns, bells, trigger bell, some combined with headlights.

* Better helmets, motorcycle-grade helmets, breathable bike visors.
  Of course, because bicyclists sweat a lot more than motorcycle
  riders.

* Rear-view mirrors, elbow mounted.

* Bike cameras.

* Bike locks, including remote trigger ones that chirp and blink like
  a Volvo.

* Anti-theft devices.

* Bar mitts, rain shields, mud guards, "spoke fins" (reduce wind
  disturbance).

* Water bottle holders, condensing water bottle.

* Power generators.

* Bike shelves, wheel storage covers.

* Trailers, bike chalk trail kit.

* Bags, baskets, storage trunks, with locks.

* Repair manuals, repair tools.

* "Shockstop" (reduce shock through handle bars).

* Biking clothes.

There is a considerable emphasis on the physical strenousness of
biking and the need for appropriate clothes and wear for that.
