What is a service mesh?  This is a great article that explains service
meshes.

Now, for a discussion in my own words.  Basically, a service mesh
allows you to throw more stuff onto the technology heap without
rearchitecting the whole system.  Definitely not a good idea if you
are designing a small systems project, but like many other similar
technologies, this facet makes it wildly popular in the large
complicated software systems sector of modern cloud computing,
enterprise back-end, etc.
