After using my Respects-your-Freedom certified router for a little
while, I've come up on a number of limitations.  Also, I've sometimes
bought additional devices to extend my network's features and
functions in ways that would not be necessary if I had one single
really good router.  So, if I were to get a new router, what features
and functions would it provide, including those found on my original
router that worked well?

* U-boot bootloader

* Hardware is still libre software friendly

* Gigabit Ethernet

* VLAN hardware switch support

* 2.4 GHz **and** 5 GHz Wi-Fi

* Fast ARM CPU

* \>= 1 GB RAM

* MicroSD card slot for gigabytes of local storage

* USB port(s), ideally with one port that has USB on-the-go support

* A box configuration that makes it easy to integrate backup
  batteries, either rechargeable or non-rechargeable.

* Optional: HDMI and audio output (!)

* Optional: Video and audio input (!)

* Optional: Infrared input port

* Optional: Integrated DSP for direct cable/DSL/fiber connection
