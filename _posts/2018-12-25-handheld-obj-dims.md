Why are printer papers bunched into reams of 500?  Beyond thinking
about the nice number of sheets that this makes in its own right, I've
come to realize there's another important reason.  This makes the
stack somewhere around 2 inches to 2.5 inches tall.  These dimensions
help ensure that the package is relatively easy to handle by hand,
both inside and out.  As it turns out, the height of my dust
suppression DSLR lens changing and film negative box has an opening of
4.5 inches, which allows it to be realtively easy for most hand sizes
to reach inside.  DLSR cameras themselves have a grip with a few
inches in height, similar to these dimensions.  Finally, cereal boxes
themselves have this approximate thickness in their dimensions.
