Now, this is interesting.  One of Microsoft's newer Microsoft Office
terms and conditions states this at the beginning.  If you are using a
enterprise volume licensed version, you do not need to read this
license, as the volume license applies to you.  Otherwise, if you are
using an individual license, then these license terms apply to you.
