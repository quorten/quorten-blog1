Dissatisfied with with previous math library designs, I made my own
that uses generics to support both integer and floating point
arithmetic in one package.  How do I feel after giving this a first
go?

I really like generics programming in C since there are times when I
can get both compact object code and an elegant programmer interface
at the same time.  There are times when I could see how the same
advanced math could be more elegantly implemented in C++, but I
realize I cannot use it due to the esoteric complexity of C++
compilers for minimal computer systems.
