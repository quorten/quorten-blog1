Why are sea mammals so large?  It's to keep the heat in and minimize
heat loss at sea, much more of a challenge than on land.  Not because
the sea frees them of the constraints of land life to grow bigger, but
because it imposes new ones.

Whales are only the absolute biggest because they have the ability to
travel long distance and find highly concentrated food deposits.
