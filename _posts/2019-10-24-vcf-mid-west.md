Ah, yes, this is interesting.  Vintage Computer Festival Mid-west,
it's in Illinois.

Also, another interesting point from the FAQ.  No printers in the free
exchange pile!  Why?  It's not a hard and fast rule, but printers are
generally very hard to give away.  Unless you plan on using them for
scrap for other projects.  Ah, good to know.  I've already accumulated
a few old printers and scanners to use for deconstructing to salvage
parts, so why not go further?
