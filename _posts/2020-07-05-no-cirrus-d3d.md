Can I get Direct3D 8 working with a virtual Cirrus video card in QEMU?
Apparently not... it's 2D only, but there are some other nice options
for VM hypervisors that work better for 3D virtualization.  VMware
Player, for instance, provides 3D acceleration drivers.  There's also
another old product that is no longer maintained but is nice where it
works, Virtual PC.
