Ubiquity networks done it again, they're doing things with their
router, switch, and access point firmware that are getting on people's
nerves.  This time, it is making firmware that indiscriminately phones
home via a secure connection, without any means of user configuration
to disable it.  Enterprise users are really upset that they are
performing "data exfiltration" transparently and sidestepping
enterprise security controls.

Also, one of Uber's self-driving SUVs has killed a jaywalking
pedestrian, the first of its kind, root cause being partly due to
Uber's software not expecting to detect a jaywalking pedestrian,
failing to recognize such, and thus failing to assign proper goals
until it was too late.  Unfortunately the SUV's emergency braking was
also disabled since it was purported to cause "erratic" behavior and
render the vehicle inoperable.

Although there was a driver at the wheel, he looked down at his phone
seconds before the impact and thus was unable to recognize and react
until it was too late.
