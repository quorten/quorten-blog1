Which license is better for public domain works?  I will provide my
judgement here:

* The Unlicense is shorter, but still longer than a simple declaration
  of being in the public domain.  Thus, it may be a good choice to get
  started for very small works.

* CC0 is longer, but it appears to be more widely adopted in the
  modern era.  Just a few years ago (2014), it was actually pretty
  hard to find major parties that used the CC0.  Nowadays, all of
  GitHub's legal terms and conditions are CC0 Public Domain.

    * Also, due to the impact of Wikipedia, Creative Commons licenses
      are generally the preference for literary works.  Due to the
      impact of Flickr, Creative Commons licenses are sometimes the
      preference for photographic works.

Truly, I wish that public domain declarations could be more painless.
They could be, but only if you ignore the jurisdictions that don't
recognize a public domain.

But wait!  Our discussion isn't finished.  What are other people
saying about CC0 versus Unlicense?

Now, this is the most compelling evidence I've found for the
Unlicense: The Unlicense is based off of the SQLite public domain
dedication, one of the most successful public domain software projects
in the world.  Also, the Unlicense is purportedly more popular,
especially with small-time projects.

But anyways, I guess you can say I've come to a round-about discussion
on the judgement here.  The length of the license correlates with the
length of the world in question.

Finally, an important point to note on the critique of the Unlicense.
Even though it is "explicitly illegal" in Germany, for sure SQLite is
used in Germany regardless of its anti-public domain law.  At this
point in time, for software it doesn't matter what the local
jurisdiction laws might say forbidding public domain.  People simply
can no longer live _without_ the concept of public domain.

* Footnote: Wow, indeed, looking at the Unlicense page of how much
  very important, core, essential software is in the public domain,
  public domain software is an unescapable reality of the modern-day
  world.  It is simply infeasible for any country that wants to plug
  into the modern economy to forbid it.

So, another question to ask.  Can you dual-license under both CC0 and
Unlicense?  Maybe, but an Internet search doesn't seem to show that
to be very common.

So now you ask, "What are you going to do with this blog?"  Well,
currently it is under the Unlicense.  As of today, I haven't yet
finished the import of all my older articles that I have already
written.  For the time being, I will wait until the bulk of the old
articles have been imported before making the changes.  However, due
to the discussion above, any change between the two shouldn't really
affect most people.  Yes, even people living in jurisdictions where
public domain is "illegal" won't be affected, as the people in those
jurisdictions don't actually observe that legal constraint anyways.

What are other people discussing about public domain in Germany?
Well, the conclusion here is that the same as what you've said:
regardless of the fact that France and Germany don't recognize public
domain, people use it and treat it as that anyways.
