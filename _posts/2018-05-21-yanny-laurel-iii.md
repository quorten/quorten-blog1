Now there's a caligraphic version of Yanny and Laurel.

Now, about the "dress" one.  First of all, this photograph is not even
correctly white-balanced.  So color comparisons cannot be made.  The
question is what color is the _dress_, not what color is the reflected
light from the dress.  That is the key distinction, which is why
proper white balance is paramount.

So, this robot dog is not trying to compete with real dogs in sense of
smell.
