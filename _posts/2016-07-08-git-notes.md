Git notes!  How do you set the HEAD without checking out a branch?

    git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/remotes/origin/master

Then you can do `git lfs fetch` (which is faster) followed by `git
checkout master`.

And don't forget, `git clone --no-checkout` is also useful too.

Update master without checkout?

    git fetch origin master:master
