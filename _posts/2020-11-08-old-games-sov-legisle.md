Running Saints of Virtue is difficult on modern hardware.  You can
start by running a Windows 98 virtual machine, but then the problem is
that the high uncapped framerate makes you jump way too high, the
enemies are clocked too fast, and some of your swords have way too
long of a delay after firing, making the game partially playable but
otherwise unbeatable.

Here's one folk's solution: They "cheat" by using a video capture tool
that can lock the video output frame refreshing to 30fps, I'd really
want to know how this works.

Also, they have a nice wiki on unpacking the game's assets for modding
and more fun.

Interesting interview about funding challenges for Christian computer
game development.

Apparently Saints of Virtue was the only game ever released by Shine
Studios, which was really just the name the two guys, Dave and Mike,
picked when working on that one product.  No other games were released
by them it looks under the Shine Studios name.

Now, what about the Lego Island computer game?  I remember seeing a
link to the tools someone else developed, but I did not yet save a
link in my blog.  These tools definitely need help, though.  Lots of
room for improvement.  But, this fixes a similar timing bug caused
from counting frame rate instead of using the system timers, along
with allowing a nice enhancement to use higher definition audio of the
soundtracks released by the original musician.
