Vitamin B12, what does Wikipedia have to say about this?  Indeed, this
is a relatively scarce vitamin in vegetable food sources, but common
in dairy, meat, eggs, and fish.  Some breakfast cereals are fortified
with vitamin B12.

The breakfast cereals of justice!  What does Wikipedia have to say
about breakfast cereals?  Indeed, there is a very interesting history
here about how breakfast cereals came about, and how they quickly
became competitive with each other.  The story of food scientists, and
fortification with vitamins and minerals, that came about later.

Freeze drying?  Basically, this works by lowering the temperature to
freeze the water to ice, then reducing hte pressure so that the ice
evaporates via sublimation.  Yeah, very interesting indeed.
