Over the past few weeks, stock prices have dropped 12% across the
board.  Yes, pretty much all stocks are down 12%, and this is
reflected in index funds like Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
(VTI).  What's happening?  As news has it, it's the Coronavirus scare
that's at fault.

Okay, so there's a lot of overly sensationalized news out there about
how people's behaviors are changing in light of the Coronavirus
outbreak, but are some of the claims legitimate?  Sure, some are, but
most are not, as we will see from our deeper analysis.

Better yet, the question to ask with the stock market is this: Which
stocks have a great opportunity opened up for buying?  With everyone
loosing confidence in the stock market, stock prices are going down
and the "clearance isle" effect is providing an excellent opportunity
to buy valuable stocks at a low price.  Chances are that the
Coronavirus outbreak will be limited in time, so when the stock market
resumes back to normal, low-valued stocks today will grow to a
competitively higher value in the future.

First of all, let's start with the essentials of the Coronavirus
outbreak.  The Coronavirus originated in China, and our main fear of
its spreading is through international transportation, in particular
human international travel because (1) it typically uses the fastest
means of travel such as air travel and (2) humans are living creatures
that function as a better host for the Coronavirus than, say, the
surfaces of raw materials and manufactured goods.

Okay, so in light of the stock market, you'd assume the primary
businesses to be affected by the Coronavirus outbreak is any business
that deals with long distance travel.  Think airlines, cruise lines,
and overseas freight shipping companies.  These are businesses whose
sales and profitability are literally being degraded by legislated
travel restrictions, and rightfully so because we don't want the virus
to spread!  But also, in some sense, it is like these businesses are
"artificially" undervalued because short-term decreases in
profitability meant their stock prices went down.  Secondarily, you
might assume that companies that provide complementary services to
travel, such as hotels, restaurants, and vehicle rental companies
would also have their stock prices being hit harder.

Let's do some cursory research on Wikipedia to get the list of
companies to look at.

20200228/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines

20200228/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapag-Lloyd  
20200228/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_container_shipping_companies

Next, I've taken a cursory look of some of the mentioned companies on
a stock market information website.

So, my consensus?  The economic complements to travel... like hotels
and restaurants, those are hardly feeling a dent, no more than the
stock market overall at 12% stock price decrease.  But, airlines and
cruise lines themselves, they're the ones getting hit hard, about 25%
down across the board.  However, Alaska Air hardly feels a dent from
the Coronavirus scare, approximately 8%, similar to the rest of the
stock market at 12% down.  Again, these are all pretty good businesses
that will resume normal activity once the Coronavirus outbreak is
under control, and they were doing fairly well before the Coronavirus
outbreak.

Companies for freight shipping at sea?  Well those are all based
countries other than the U.S., and I pretty much can't see anything at
all in data for these, they are shown as "over-the-counter" markets,
which means they're not listed on major stock exchanges like the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Finally, down to the process of elimination, do you really want to own
these businesses?  Between airlines and cruise lines, both businesses
involve inherent risks and disasters.  Cruise lines are obviously a
minority compared to commercial air travel.  But there's a final
factor to consider.  What is their ethical standing?  Can you live
with the sins they've committed in the past, and their disposition on
how that likely affects how they will act in the future?

Carnival Cruise lines, well they've been dumping oil into the oceans
mixed in with their bilge water.  Okay, first offense, been doing it
for a couple of years, they get fines and probation for the next 5
years, that's fine.  But then as soon as they're probation period
ends, they do it again?  And when on probation again, they do it yet
again?  And they've been deliberately falsifying records on how much
they've been dumping?  Unacceptable.  Dumping oil in water, yeah
that's really bad, not the place you want to dump oil if you must dump
it somewhere.

Okay, so MY PICK of individual companies to invest in, and the
proportions to invest adjusted by the size of their business (I used
Wikipedia's count of their passengers carried in 2019):

1. American Airlines, 1/1x
2. Delta Air Lines, 1/1x
3. Southwest Airlines, 1/1.3x
4. United Airlines, 1/1.3x
5. Air Canada, 1/4x (over-the-counter market)
6. Alaska Air Group, 1/4x
7. JetBlue Airways, 1/4x
8. Spirit Airlines, 1/6x
9. Allegiant Travel Co., 1/12x
10. Hawaiian Holdings Inc., 1/20x

Use $200 for 1/1x share as baseline to multiply and round to number of
shares.  Total investment = 4.588x max = $917.692 baseline investment.

----------

Another question is how much to invest out of your entire stock
portfolio?  Where you you stop when it comes to adding "more" money
into your airline investments?

Let's start with an easy way of explaining.  Right now the whole stock
market is down 12%.  If you invest 10% into airlines and 90% into the
total stock market, the worst things can get long term is that you
loose everything in the airlines and are left with 90% in the rest of
the stock market?  Is that a tolerable risk?  I think so.

Let's say the worst things could get is that airlines go down 50% long
term, so you can invest up to 20% in airlines and 80% in the rest of
the stock market and have the same degree of risk.

But finally, there's the philosophical approach, of primary goals.
You only want to be investing artificially more in airlines short term
because they are relatively undervalued short term.  So of course
that's how you're putting your money in the short term... and if you
are catching up for existing missed investment opportunities in the
past, you are not going to put that on the line.

For me, it's like 3 years catch-up and one year present.  So yeah, say
20%, then adjust by 1/4, so that's 5%.  So for me, actually 5% is
pretty much the hard cap.  I would be able to exceed that only if I am
extra opportunistic such that I would be willing to sell some of my
total stock market shares to increase my share in airline stocks
short-term.
