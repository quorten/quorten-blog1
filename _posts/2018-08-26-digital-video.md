Digital video?  What does Wikipedia have to say about that?
Oh, Wikipedia has a pretty good and interesting history
section on the subject.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Yes, indeed it is
serial digital interface (SDI) that is not found on most consumer
equipment because it is uncompressed, and various licensing agreements
often prohibit the use of uncompressed video signals for consumer use.
