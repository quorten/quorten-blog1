Oil prices are crashing, does that mean it's a good time to buy
stocks?  Hold on, there's a problem looming ahead.  Answer the
question, why are oil prices crashing?  Because there is no place to
store the oil, so oil producers must pay refiners to cough up some
spare storage locations and become ever closer to 100% storage
consumed.  But by doing so, oil companies are loosing money.  And if
they keep loosing money through this means for too long, they will go
bankrupt.  Why can't they just stop producing oil?  Because for many
oil rigs, if you shut it off, you'll never get it back going
again... not without the extreme labor required to set it up in the
beginning.

So, therein lies the problem.  If the deal is too good, and it
destroys companies, there will be nothing left to invest in.
