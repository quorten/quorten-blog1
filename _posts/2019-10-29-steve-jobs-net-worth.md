Back around the year 2010, when Steve Jobs was still alive, the
Wikipedia page on him listed his net worth, and I think that indeed
was also how I first learned about net worth.  Now, I wonder, has the
Wikipedia page been updated to note this modern omission?  Well, the
net worth has been removed, but the Wikipedia page says nothing about
what happened to it.  It says in every other way what his legacy has
been, though.

So I go looking elsewhere.  And here I find some information.  Some of
it, a few millions, was given away to his children, split equally.
$21 billion went to Ms. Powell Jobs, his second wife, which then when
to philanthropy and she launched the "launched the Emerson Collective,
an organization that pursues liberal political activism and for-profit
investments, and owns a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine."  So
there you go, that covers at least most of it.

Also, there is some other interesting information about Steve Jobs and
his first daughter on this page.  Lisa Brennan-Jobs was neglected by
her father early on, but he slowly came around to try to be more
involved.  She wrote a memoir, and one thing written that sums it up
is "we're just cold people."

Ah, interesting!  The page on remembering Steve Jobs is still on the
Apple website.  Despite their restructuring, they have not deleted the
page, yet.
