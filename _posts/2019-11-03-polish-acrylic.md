How do polish acrylic (PMMA) plastic to a glass-like shine?  If you
use fine-grit sandpaper, you can improve the shininess of acrylic
quite a bit, but to get a glass-like shine, you must use careful
technique with a propane torch.  Quickly pass a propane torch from
edge-to-edge of the acrylic taking care not to melt or burn your
material, or else it will be ruined.  See the wikihow article for full
details.

So, armed with knowledge of this technique, you can proceed to finish
3D printed acrylic parts, provided that you have good solid formation
in the middle of the material.  100% infill, without interior layering
boundaries.
