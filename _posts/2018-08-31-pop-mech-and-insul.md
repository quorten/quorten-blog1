Popular Mechanics?  Yeah, we already know what Wikipedia has to say
about them: not much.  Okay then, let's do a web search and go to
their website.

Wow, now this looks like an interesting article.  But...  when I read
into it, the biases are clear.  Sure, Popular Mechanics is about
mechanics, but this list of 100 skills everyone should know are
clearly slanted toward that bias.  Especially, vehicles, and cars in
particular.  I only skimmed this list, but I've found one reference of
"manly," another bias if it needed to be stated that way.

Beyond the bias, there are a few clearly agreeable important skills in
there:

* escaping from a car on water,
* building a fire,
* split firewood,
* paddle a canoe,
* filleting a fish,
* shoot straight,
* find potable water,
* navigate with map and compass,
* grill with charcoal,
* build a shelter,
* cast a line,
* tie a bowline knot,
* hang food in the wild,
* use a sledgehammer,
* put out a fire,
* changing a diaper,
* whittle wood,
* grow food,
* escape a rip current,
* treat a snakebite,
* surviving frostbite,
* treat burns,
* handle seizures,
* remove ticks,
* shovel the right way,
* reverse hypothermia,
* perform the Heimlich,
* Perform Hands-Only CPR.

Also, I don't entirely agree on the ordering they placed the skills
in.  A lot of the technology-based skills of course require such
technology being built in the first place.  Thus I've omitted over 2/3
of the listed skills.  It's clear that if the technology exists,
having the using skill is important, but in general you would have to
assume such technologies won't be found in the wild.  So, those other
skills are clearly a divide between the developed world and the
undeveloped world.

Oh, and I like the tips for teaching bike-riding by taking the pedals
off a bike.  The learner will learn to use it as a scooter, and when
they get more experienced, they'll start gliding, then they'll want
the pedals back on.

On another note, this article.  Yeah, this article is really useful
relating to quality metrics of a well-built home, and how to improve
an existing one.  Particularly interesting points:

* Once you make a home more efficient in temperature control, you may
  need to control for humidity separately.  For air-conditioned
  environments, you may need to run a separate de-humidifier more
  frequently than the air conditioner to prevent the risks of mold
  growth and rotting that come from a excessively high humidity.

* Beyond insulation in the attic, if the upper rooms are too warm in
  the summer, putting a _radiant barrier_, a shiny foil-faced sheet,
  in the attic can help keep things cooler.  Place this on the
  underside of the roof joists and be sure to leave spacing at the
  edges so that condensation does not form on the roof.
