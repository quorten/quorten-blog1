Humans are creatures of habit, which makes innovation difficult for
them.  Now, what about businesses?  Surely there is a similar dynamic
going on which is why businesses fail to innovate and reach their
demise.  Well, often times in the business world, especially in the
big business world, the picture is much more complicated.  Often
times, a business literally has the future on "the tip of their
tongue," they have an internal research department that presents the
next big thing right up to upper management on a silver platter, but
they fail to act on that knowledge and thus reach their demise.

The list of how big businesses failed to innovate and why is
jaw-dropping with suspense, with countless classics like how Kodak
failed to take hold of the digital photography revolution despite
being the literal inventor of it.

So, circling back to my previous suspicion, well, no, not really, it
isn't solely because of human habits that businesses fail to innovate.
It's a collective decision-making failure across a community.  Upper
management has their habitual operation, they hold their prejudices
and biases, and the lower workers sometimes aren't punctual enough in
questioning the establishment.  Other times they are, and they decide
to leave and start a competitor that out-competes the old management.
In any case, the picture is much more complicated and not so simple to
explain in the business sector.
