Too bad I didn't get to this subject earlier.  Microsoft Officially
killed off Windows phone in 2017.  No more Windows Phones means that
there are really only two mainstream mobile phone operating systems
left: iOS and Android.  Tough luck to try to put a third one into this
ecosystem by any means.
