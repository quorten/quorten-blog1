This article is about some interesting observations of a particular
house cleaner.

However, reading the conclusion and thinking about this, something
comes to mind.  This is a bit of an over-generalization.  My point
here, is that for those who are truly rich and have large properties
tend not to hire other people to clean them.  They are highly
ambitious do-it-all folks.  But that do-it-all ambition may not last
forever, and some of those folks may decide to start hiring house
cleaners rather than moving to a smaller house.  That's where this
house cleaner's experience comes into play.  For others, they may have
had poor strategic decision making from the start, and that's why they
got into their current conditions.  That's the other side of this
house cleaner's experience.
