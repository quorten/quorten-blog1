Random notes.

McDonalds?  When was it founded?  Oh, actually it is a pretty old
company, starting around the 1955 is when Ray Kroc came onboard, but
it was around as early as 1940.  Worthy of note, Ray Kroc was a very
aggressive business partner.  Could that still be observed in
McDonald's upper management as of today?  It seems like it, at least
from the anecdotal evidence that I've heard of so far.

Also, as a food company, McDonald's was involved in related food
production controversies.
