Sources of information in your daily life:

* Your communications:

    * What you see, hear, read, learn

    * What you draw, photograph, say, write, teach

* Your actions:

    * What you design, build, repair, install, setup, etc.

    * What you recycle, repurpose, dispose, etc.

    * What you replace

    * What you buy, get, etc.

    * What you sell, donate, etc.

* Marketing: What other people want you to...

    * See, hear, learn

    * Say, teach, but **not** draw or photograph!  Only the proprietor
      has those rights.  However, it is increasingly becoming
      acceptable to photograph if done with a smartphone for the
      purpose of "word-of-mouth" marketing.

    * Buy

    * Replace

    * Build?  Ha!  We know that marketers know better not to ask you
      to do something too involved.

    * Recycle?  Ha!  Marketers know better than that.

    * Sell?  Sometimes, but not as frequent as advertising a buy.

Now, that being said, what does Wikipedia have to say about junk mail?
Oh, interesting, the article title is advertising mail.  Also
interesting is the database marketing article.
