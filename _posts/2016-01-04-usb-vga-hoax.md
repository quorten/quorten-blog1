USB VGA sounds kind of like a hoax.  Is it?  To some extent, yes it
is.

The current solutions rely on video compression algorithms.  And, as
you know with any data compression algorithm, there is always the
possibility of a worse-case that cannot be compressed at all.  What
happens when a video signal relies on a channel that cannot send
enough video bandwidth except when the signal is compressed?  What
happens when an uncompressed signal must travel to the destination in
time?  Nothing, because it can't reach its destination in time.

Interesting link, just saving it here for reference.
