Wow, this is really interesting.  Nasca lines?  Puquitos?  The purpose
behind these giant colossal constructions has now been revealed.  It
was behind a massive water distribution system built to bring water to
one of the most arid places on earth, to grow farms, to build a highly
advanced civilization.  Wow, now that is really interesting, they were
really expert builders out in the South American, Mesoamerican region.

Those who have the technological know-how to distribute water in such
a reason, they hold the very key to life itself.  And, therefore, they
wielded a significant amount of political power.
