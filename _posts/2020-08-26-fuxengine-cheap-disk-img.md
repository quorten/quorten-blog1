Want to get a flux disk imager on the cheap?  Check out FluxEngine, a
design that takes an existing development board and programs it to
connect directly to IBM PC floppy disk drives.  These are then
controlled so that you can capture flux disk images.  How is that for
inexpensive?

Sure, the newer designs are essential if you expect to manufacture
with all new hardware.
