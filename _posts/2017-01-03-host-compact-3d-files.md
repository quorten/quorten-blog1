Oh, good idea.  Web converter can also be used on local files too.  In
case someone doesn't want to setup the command-line converter and
wants compact storage formats for local files.

In the real world, you can typically only deflate hollow objects, but
once you scan only the surface in 3D into the computer, you can
deflate even solid objects.  All you do is specify the outside and
state that the interior is "solid."

Again, I reiterate.  When a field is in its infancy, an imperative
language and format works best, because it allows for the easiest
expansion.  As a matter of fact, the same can be said about the early
computing profession.  It was in its "infancy," so it needed an
imperative instruction set.  But, as applications became more
established, they moved toward a "data-driven" approach.

Anyways, this is especially true for the field of computer graphics,
because as computers constantly get more advanced, it is possible to
keep adding new graphics functions that result in an increasingly more
realistic experience.  So, even though computer graphics may be a
"mature" field in terms of the basics, because it is still rapidly
advancing, it needs a graceful way to expand and extend itself.

Ha.  There was something else I was going to tell you about 3D
scanning if you were in office later today, but I won't tell you it
since you'll be remote.  You might have figured this out, but at the
moment, three-dimensional geometry is not very conducive to
telepresence.  Of course, that's one of the reasons for my involvement
with 3D scanning.  I hope to change that.  :wink:
