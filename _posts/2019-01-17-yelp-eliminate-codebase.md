Ha!  Very interesting.  Yelp trained an artificial neural network to
eliminate **all** bugs in the app, and it ended up deleting
everything.  They had to roll back.

"Can't have any bugs... if you don't have any code"

Of course, because often times, the solution to a bug may be deleting
extra code.  Taken to its full end, you simply delete all code.

"There was another case when the neural net was playing Tetris and in
order to avoid losing, it was putting the game on pause."
