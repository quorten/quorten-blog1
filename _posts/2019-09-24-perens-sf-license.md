Great reiteration of the purpose of copyright law in Bruce Peren's
article here, in this article evaluating the enforceablity of the
claims in the Hippocratic License.  Interesting to see another one of
these kinds of licenses come about, and the criticisms about it.  The
license in nature is similar to Douglas Crockford's JSMin and JSLint
licenses that had the following term:

> The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil

However, the Hippocratic License extends this with a longer
description.
