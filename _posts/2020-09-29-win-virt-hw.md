3D graphics on Windows 98 virtual machines?  Well, apparently it is
possible for Windows XP, but you have to use a very specific version
of VirtualBox, 5.2.40.

But Windows 98, well that's up in the air.  Nevertheless, I've found
this PCem emulator that is touted to maybe emulated accelerated 3D
graphics.

Oh, and mention of a VOGONS archive?  Well, that must be where there's
a big vintage computing community similar to the case of 68kMLA.
Indeed, it is.  And, well, yeah, there is always still the MSFN
community too.

Interesting discussion here on making Linux PPP setup easier for "fake

Oh, wow.  Most folks are mounting the disk images from a NAS share and
then using Windows software drivers to get the equivalent of CD audio,
rather than taking a more hardware virtualization path.  But, totally
understandable given the community politics issues I've presented thus
earlier.
