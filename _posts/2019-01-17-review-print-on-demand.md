I was thinking about that GitHub user profile picture where I saw a QR
barcode that contained text like "day 39 they still think I'm a
barcode."  Is there any larger scale meaning and sources behind that
message?  Apparently not.

Failed search.

On the other hand, I found this interesting review of different
print-on-demand services.

Also, this was part of an interesting project that the author was
working on, a book about a party where friends were invited to read
parts of books that have changed their lives.  Party Where We Read
Things.  There was a copyright inquiry that went back and forth with
one of the print-on-demand providers, since the book necessarily
included quotes and passages from other copyrighted works.
