Do you see reference to active low and active high in an integrated
circuit datasheet?  Don't worry, the intuitive meaning is the correct
meaning.

* Active low: When this input is driven low, "enable" the indicated
  function.

* Active high: When this input is driven high, "enable" the indicated
  function.
