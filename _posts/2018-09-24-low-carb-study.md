Very interesting article here.  A false study that uses poor data
leads to a conclusion that low-carb diets are unhealthy?  It has come
from reputable sources.  And, well, the problem is this: the large
"reputable" institutions like Harvard have chairs in key strategic
positions that set the manufacturing and distribution at which certain
foods are circulated through the economy.  And when this is based off
of false data, potentially deliberately, it can be used to support key
poltical funding motives.
