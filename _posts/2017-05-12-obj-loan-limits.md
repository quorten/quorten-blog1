* The idea.  Loaning objects?  Distance equations, and use factors.
  Then what about a robotic warehouse?  Wouldn't that be the most
  competitive?

    * It would, but it is not a practical reality at the moment.
      Human-operated computers, on the other hand, are.

    * But still, it's an interesting future vision.  The idea that
      people would want to personally own less so that they can have
      the conveniences of the robotically automated management system.

        * And the living reality that this is already the case.  The
          fact that people tend to buy things online or go to a store
          when they want something rather than realizing and using the
          objects in their immediate vincity.  That there is in fact a
          strong market demand for this.

            * But also the reality that people put things in their
              local vincity and forget about them.  Why did they bring
              them there?  Because it would be more convenient for
              short-term use.

              So also the potential there for new technologies.  Ones
              that can better integrate with the robotically managed
              facilities.

            * Yes, yes, yes.  Again, I reiterate, because this is
              important!  Technology complacency is always an integral
              part of human psychology.  Even when there is a more
              technological solution to a particular problem, that
              doesn't mean that people will take advantage of it.  So
              even after we design all kinds of technologies to solve
              all the worlds problems, we'll still have those problems
              in the world simply due to some people neglecting to
              pick up the technology that helps them solve the
              problem.

              In other words, it's not possible to solve all the
              world's problems through technology.  Again, I
              reiterate, because this is important!  Yeah, it really
              is like you said before.
