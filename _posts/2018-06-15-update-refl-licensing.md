Public domain is the goal, but lawyers seem, and everyone else thinks
that actual license texts have some magic words quality to it.  Also,
there are some people who wouldn't otherwise use a project if it was
public domain rather than permissively licensed.  So fine.  "Dual
licensed."  Your choice, either the public domain version or the MIT
licensed version.
