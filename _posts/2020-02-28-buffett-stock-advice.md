This is a really good article on Warren Buffett's advice for a stock
market crash, lots of good points stated.  Keep a level head, remember
that when you invest in stocks, you are a business owner and these are
businesses, not just ticker symbols.  If they have good business
behind them, things will work out well in the long run even if they
are not doing well in the short run.
