Stores and news outlets have blamed toilet paper hoarders for the
cause of the toilet paper shortage, but even after stores have placed
limits on customers on how much toilet paper they can buy, they are
still encountering shortages.  Why is this?  One of the big reasons
not to be neglected is the fundamental shift in where people are
spending their time: from commercial settings to full-time at home.
As it turns out, toilet paper for the commercial market is a radically
different product than the consumer market toilet paper, and it isn't
easy to turn around that excess that is no longer being used at
schools, businesses, restaurants, etc. and get it onto retail store
shelves.  Commercial toilet paper is much more utilitarian and bland,
whereas consumer toilet paper is all about bright decorative retail
packaging and "special effects" on the actual toilet paper itself.

As it stands, there's enough tellings about how awful the toilet paper
at the gas station is.  Yeah, it's really not that nice, but when you
really have to go to the bathroom, it gets the job done.
