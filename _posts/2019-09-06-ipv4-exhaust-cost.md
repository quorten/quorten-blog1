Nowadays, some Zoom video host websites are IPv6-only, and this causes
problems for old dinosaur networks within enterprise companies.
Seriously, I'd assume that they made such a decision out of pure
economics.  With IPv4 address exhaustion, an IPv4 address must be
pretty expensive nowadays, is it?  After some rough and tough
searching, indeed, it purportedly get more expensive, and some
companies are dropping their IPv4 addresses to save money.  But, this
problem notwithstanding, this is not speeding up the transition from
IPv4 to IPv6.
