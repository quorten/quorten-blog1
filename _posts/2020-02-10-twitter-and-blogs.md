So, I'm looking for different solutions for creating a commenting
ability on my blog, and the idea came, how about using Twitter to post
comments to my blog?  Well, the big disadvantage with that is that the
Twitter API can only search within the last week.  There you go, not a
long-term solution.

Additionally, I've found this interesting article about folks
lamenting Twitter and Facebook posts compared to good old lively blog
comments.  The length limit on Twitter tweets is one of its key
weaknesses.
