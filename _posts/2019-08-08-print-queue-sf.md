Out of interest, I saw that there happened to be a certain "Preton
saver" software on my work computer.  What is that?  It is another
print queue manager.  Oh, wow, now that reminds me.  Paper Cut was the
print queue manager software used at University of Minnesota CSELabs
as it was called back in 2015.  Now in 2019, it is named something
more like IT Public Labs.  Preton Saver looks kind of outdated
compared to Paper Cut.

Interestingly, Paper Cut also has additional features for "specialty"
job ticketing: anything from poster printing to 3D printing.
