I haven't used SourceForge.net in a long time.  Worthy of note, I
bought my solar charger through ThinkGeek, that I saw through an ad
link on SourceForge.net.  What ever happened to SourceForge.net?
Well, we know that GitHub has since taken away most of the market
share from SourceForge.net.  But the real showstopper for
SourceForge.net was some malbehavior in 2013 where they modified the
Windows installers for some software, without the project owner's
permission, that installed adware.  The goal was an "additional
revenue option" as traditional ads revenue was dwindling (not
surprisingly because the user base was dwindling too).  This feature
was touted to be optional and opt-in by project owners, but
SourceForge staff got greedy, "declared projects to be abandoned," and
took over projects with SourceForge staff accounts.  This even
happened with active projects like GIMP?  The result?  Active projects
got quite angered and decided to wholeheartedly move off of
SourceForge.net.  Then that was the end of it.

SourceForge.net gets new owners who promptly stop this malpractice?
Nope, those who left aren't coming back... ever, again!  Because the
"software profession" is unforgiving, as it is a swarm of millions of
independent organizations and individuals that are not in constant,
perfect communication and synchronization with the whole of each
other.
