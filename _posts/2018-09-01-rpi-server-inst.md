Wondering how to get a good old `debian-installer` network installer
experience for the Raspberry Pi?  Look here for starters.

Obsolete, don't use.  Use replacement `raspbian-ua-netinst` instead.

Well, that's good enough for me, I guess.  Sure, it would be nice to
have a traditional `debian-installer` experience, but I guess it makes
sense considering the Raspberry Pi I'm setting up won't have a display
and keyboard attached to it.  Serial console over USB is still an
option, though.
