Oh yeah.  This is important.  The future of 3D data.  The future of 3D
data is meshes, believe it or not.  Why is this?  Because, in the end,
we want to have the 3D equivalent of pixel-based photographs.  Mesh
points are what bring you closest to that ideal.  NURBS, not so much.
Probably what we will be aiming for is defining points to be the
rendering basis, but using other algorithms to achieve lossy data
compression, similar to what is being used for JPEG, but perhaps the
concepts will be ported to be based off of NURBS instead.  And a
combination of bump maps, possibly JPEG compressed, or compressed via
a modified DCT/DWT algorithm.
