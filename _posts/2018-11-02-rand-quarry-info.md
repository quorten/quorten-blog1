Why am I looking up Quarry on Wikipedia?  A workgroup decided to use
that as their random name.

Now, this is really interesting, nice, and, well, somewhat funny too.
Wheel washing system, so that those dump trucks coming out of a
construction site don't get the roads all dirty with dirt trekked up
on their tires.  Funny because of what I think about when I saw a big
water truck spraying non-potable water down onto the road to wash the
road.
