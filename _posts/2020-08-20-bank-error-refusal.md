Oh wow, now this is really interesting.  Citibank made a financial
error that wired 100 times more money to a hedge fund Brigade Capital,
and in the wrong direction too?  This was part of supporting a loan on
behalf of Revlon, the cosmetics company in financial trouble when
people aren't going out and buying as much makeup as they once did.
