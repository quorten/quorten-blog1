So, you're wondering.  Can you get cloud hosting on a Raspberry Pi
nowadays?  Yes you can!  I've found two solutions, both of which
basically hinge around the concept of "colocation facilities," but
built specifically for Raspberry Pi servers, not PC-sized servers.
The "best hosting" solution is based in Europe.  Overall, it sure is
nice as you can mail in your own Raspberry Pi and get it sent back to
you when you are no longer using the service, but the big problem for
me is that it won't make sense for me to have my dedicated server
based in Europe when I am based in the United States.  That being
said, unfortunately I've only found one such cloud hosting provider in
the United States and it is not as nice as the European cloud hosting
solution.

What are the prices for Raspberry Pi hosting?  $4 on the "best
hosting" service, $8 on the mininodes service.  So, in some places the
prices are really great, but it's not quite a uniform phenomenon yet.
