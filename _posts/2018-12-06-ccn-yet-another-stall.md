Really, I'm wondering, what is the current status of content-centric
networking?  It's been a really long time since I've heard of any
updates on it.

It's interesting that the Wikipedia article does not have any talk
page.

Okay, so let's find the GitHub project for it, as it is not linked
from Wikipedia.

Navigating to the official CCN project, the first thing I see is that
it has a redirect note to the modern project that replaced it.

Yet, looking at this "more modern" GitHub project, the GitHub project
was last updated two years ago, in 2016.  There are only 19 forks of
this project.  There you go, I think that says it all.

So, is there any information on the discontinuation of CCN?
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it.  It's just yet another one of
those projects that comes in with a great publicity announcement, but
slips away simply by being slowly forgotten.

Wow, this is really interesting.  The title says it all: Over 1,000
cryptocurrencies are dead projects.  I guess, you can say, perhaps
this is one of the things that most sets cryptocurrency apart from
typical fiat currency.  Even more so, what sets cryptocurrency apart
from paper "play money."  The fact that cryptocurrency, being complex
software, can get stalled and much harder to pick up by someone else
than currencies of simpler means.
