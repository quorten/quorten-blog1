Can you mix leaded and lead-free solder on the same board?  In
general, no.  Avoid this whenever you can, because if the two
different types of solder ever do directly mix together on the same
board, you run the risk of the solder joint becoming brittle over time
and cracking, which will then need to be repaired.

Also, please note... that being said, if you are repairing old
electronics, please please **please** prefer to use leaded solder.
Future buyers will not like a board that has been ruined by mixing
incorrect solder types.

Also, another good point in the discussion on the particular
forum I've found.

Notes on lead-free solder types for your own uses, avoid
Tin-silver-copper solder for your own uses, it's best only for
automated assembly.  Reworking and repairing with this type of solder
is a real pain, prefer to use 99% tin or 100% tin solder instead.  Not
only is this much easier to work with, but it has also been proven to
work well for automated assembly mass production.
