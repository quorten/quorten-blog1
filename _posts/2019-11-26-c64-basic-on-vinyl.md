Interesting, a C64 BASIC program found on a Christian rock band vinyl
record.  Good to know that they were sufficiently into programming
back them to get around to pulling off that trick.  Nowadays it seems
that kind of thing is much rarer in popular culture, especially
smaller sub-segments and sub-cultures therein.
