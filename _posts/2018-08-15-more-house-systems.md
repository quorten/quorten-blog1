More house systems, in order of construction.  Note the importance of
the quality of each system.  If the system is mentioned, than there is
an associated quality metric.

Core structure (maps, data sheets):

1. Ground

2. Foundation

3. Concrete block

4. Concrete slab (sometimes done late in the process)

5. Post and lintel structural frame (studs, beams)

6. Roof rafter

7. Outside wall panel/sheathing/sheeting

8. Roof panel/sheathing/sheeting

9. Insulation

Core structure that is also a utility line or appliance (maps, data
sheets):

1. Indoor ventilation.

    * Air vent

    * Air return vent

2. Ventilation between indoor and outdoor.

    * Fireplace chimneys

    * Furnace exhaust vents

    * HVAC air intake vents

    * Laundry dryer air vent

    * Bathroom exhaust vents

    * Kitchen exhaust vents

    * Attic air vents

3. Doors

4. Windows

5. Window screens

Outside finishing (maps):

* Home wrap

* Outer siding

* Roof shingles

* Roof flashing

* Gutters and water drainage

    * Garden hose

So now you're wondering, how does this integrate with the plans?
Well, of course each such mentioned item can be modeled as a separate
layer, and layers can be grouped into the higher levels as mentioned
above.  Also, for ease of use, it's important that two-dimensional
diagrams of each can be produced, so that computers are not required
to understand the information and store it away compactly.  Finally,
each such item can be numbered, and regions can also be numbered.

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  How do you make sure
that this information gets documented up-front during initial
construction.  Be clear that you want a "survey crew" of a sort to
follow through the construction process.

Logs!  So, now you're wondering about logs.  We have a few different
types that need to be discussed separately:

* Service and repair log (supply side)

* Use log (demand side)

Unfortunately, logs can become a sticky situation in terms of data
volume, especially use logs.  Because of this, digital computer
systems might be the only feasible way to convey such information.

There should be a dedicated storage cabinet to store all the
information pertinent to the home.  But where should it be located?
Okay, here are some design considerations:

* Near the electrical breaker box and fire alarm control panel is the
  ideal location.

* The cabinet should probably be located up high on the wall for
  convenience, and to keep it out of (easy) reach of children.

* The cabinet should not be in a location that is too likely to get
  flooded.  Mounting the cabinet off the floor can satisfy this
  requirement.

* The cabinet needs to be large enough to house rolled up blueprint
  sheets.

* Another idea to consider: There might be "satellite" cabinets in
  other locations, such as the kitchen, garage, etc.  Note, however,
  that satellite cabinets are not necessary: if the user has a
  preference for using paper manuals, they may be convenient to place
  duplicates within, but the originals need not be contained within
  the satellite cabinets.  Especially in the case that the user has a
  preference for digital information systems, satellite cabinets are
  not necessary.

* A word must be said on digital computer data: The ideal form of
  digital computer data that most people are accustomed to is that
  which is a very close mapping reduction to paper and appliance
  control panels: PDF documents (word processor document,
  presentation), spreadsheets, and web UIs.  Also, the format of
  computer data access that is most future resistant are those used to
  access the Internet today: the digital data host should be a
  computer server, not merely a digital storage media such as an USB
  external hard drive or SD card.  CAD file formats and other more
  detailed data is a bonus feature of a digital computer system, not a
  required feature.

* When possible, it is more ideal to have documents in a "born
  digital" format.  For example, PDF documents generated directly from
  computer document authoring software rather than scanned from analog
  documents.

Other appliances:

* User-owned long term appliances: Cookware, Dishes, Microwave Oven,
  Refrigerators, Laundry washing machine, Laundry dryer.

* Everything else: consumer electronics, fast moving consumer packaged
  goods, office supplies, etc.
