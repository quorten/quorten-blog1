Wow, 16th century math textbook with pop-up models.  The book was a
translation of Euclid's classic geometry publication.  That really was
a thing, the pop-up models were hand-glued into the textbook after
printing.  Pretty interesting, especially that back then, they were
willing to not only put together such an expensive textbook, but that
people were also willing to buy it in substantial numbers.
