So yes, there is DirtyPCBs which is one way to 3D print with PayPal
without creating an account on the host's website, but are there other
ways?  It would be nice to not have to ship from China, to have
something more local.  Apparently not.  In general, PayPal is hated by
the 3D printing community, as evidenced by these articles.

While I'm at it, I found some other useful links on 3D printing
that I thought I should save.

This is a commercial custom shoe maker that uses 3D printing.  If you
have some specific design in mind, E-mail with your request.  Hooray!
