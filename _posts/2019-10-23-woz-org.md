So I decided to visit Woz.org to look for some interesting things.
Steve Wozniak sure is an interesting and important fellow in the
founding of Apple, but yeah, although he does get more media coverage
than your average person, he doesn't get as much media coverage as
Steve Jobs got.

If he hadn't been an inventor, what would he be instead?  A stand-up
comedian, he likes to make people laugh.
