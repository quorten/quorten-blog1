So, I've come to an interesting point in time.  My sister wanted to
take some pictures, and she asked about me coming to use my DSLR
camera.  I suggested that she just started with a smartphone camera,
and we would take retakes later with the DSLR camera.  Why?  Suffice
it to say, I know she doesn't really know what she wants out of the
photos.  Of course DSLR cameras can give you a lot of options, but at
this point, the main reason why I must be skeptic about is because
even though I can bring multiple lenses with me, I don't have a setup
or any practice for changing lenses "on the go," outside of a clean
indoor environment.  Also, as it turns out, my sister specifically
wants to take the photos outdoors.

So, now to detail my recommendations.  First you start by taking
photos with a smartphone camera, point-and-shoot camera, or some other
compact and convenient camera that you know that will emphasize the
point to your client/customer that the best way to know what you want
out of photos is to take some of your own photos with your own
equipment.  After all, that's even what some professionals recommend
too.

Next comes the professional review process, where you, the more
experienced photographer, reviews the photos that your client/customer
took and asks them some customer-focused questions about what they
want out of their photos from a technical standpoint that can only be
achieved through the use of more expensive optics.  The answers to
these questions can then be translated to the more technical
specifications about what optical equipment to use.

1. Do you think the photos have too much noise?  Are you dissatisfied
   with the noise patterns you see?

2. Are you dissatisfied with the color gamut of your photos?  Try
   printing them out.  Does the color gamut leave room to be wished
   for?

3. Are you dissatisfied with the luminosity dynamic range rendering of
   your photos?  Check for dark tones in your photos.  You might see a
   telltale "banding" or "stair-step" pattern with conspicuous noise
   due to the limited digitizing precision of your smartphone camera
   sensor.  Are you dissatisfied with that?

4. Are you dissatisfied with the shutter speed of your smartphone
   camera?  Is there too much motion blur in your photos?  Would you
   prefer a faster shutter speed and shorter exposure time?

5. Are you dissatisfied with the lighting conditions in the photos?

   Would you prefer using a flash unit to correct the lighting
   conditions?

6. What field of view do you want out of the photos?  Do you want a
   wide angle lens or a narrow angle lens?  If they haven't already,
   ask them to try taking some photos with their smartphone camera at
   double distance and triple distance and zoomed in.  What do they
   think about the overall photo composition in comparison?  Do they
   like the wide angle or narrow angle photos better?

   Are you willing to compromise on sharpness in order to have the
   desired field of view?

7. What depth-of-field do you want?  Do you want the full frame to be
   in focus, or would you rather have the subject in focus and the
   background blurred?

   Would you be willing to compromise on the focus of the subject in
   order to have a stronger background blur effect?

8. If you want a narrow depth-of-field, are you okay with vignetting?
   This means that the edges of the photo frame are darker compared to
   the center.  Your smartphone lens will show no vignetting.

   Alternatively, would you like the effect corrected in software?

   Alternatively, do you deliberately want a vignetting effect in your
   photos?  Are you willing to have this effect if it means decreasing
   the depth-of-field?

9. How do you want to view the photo?  Do you want to poster print the
   resulting photo?  Do you want to view the resulting photo on a 4K
   UHD HDRI TV?  Try printing the photo out on a consumer inkjet
   printer.  Are you dissatisfied with the resolution?  Do you want to
   be able to zoom and pan a large, high resolution photo on a
   smartphone screen?

   Are you willing to wait for longer download times when viewing on a
   smartphone?

   Do you want to project the photo with a digital projector?  Do you
   want to print analog slides and project with an analog projector?

10. Are you dissatisfied with the sharpness of your camera's photos?
    Zoom into your photos by a factor of 10 on your smartphone screen
    and check if you want to see more detail.  Also compare the center
    sharpness with the edge sharpness.  Are you dissatisfied with the
    focus aberration of your smartphone camera?

11. If you are okay with less sharp photos, are you dissatisfied with
    the pixel resolution of your photos?  Note that this concept must
    be understood and evaluated separately from _sharpness_.  Zoom
    into your photos by a factor of 10 on your smartphone screen and
    check if you want to see more pixels, even if this may mean you
    will not see more _detail_.

Determining which lens to bring to the site requires answers to
multiple questions.  Once all relevant questions are answered, you
know what lens to bring with you on your DSLR camera, so you can mount
that in your studio and bring it with you to the site.  No need for
changing bags or tricks like changing lenses blind underneath a coat.

Now that we've got answers to those questions, let's transition back
to the professional side.  What gear should you bring with you based
off of the answers from the customer side?

* Smartphone
    * Wide angle, small aperture preferred.
    * Don't care about resolution, noise, sharpness, color gamut,
      luminosity dynamic range, depth-of-field, vignetting, shutter
      speed.
    * There were no issues with the lighting being too dim in the
      photos taken by the smartphone.

* Point-and-shoot camera
    * Wide angle, medium aperture preferred.
    * Lower noise levels, better luminosity dynamic range, better
      color gamut preferred.
    * Don't care about resolution, sharpness, color gamut,
      depth-of-field, vignetting, shutter speed.
    * Flash unit available.
    * There may have been issues with lighting being too dim in the
      photos taken by the smartphone, but these are acceptably
      corrected by a flash unit.

* DSLR camera body
    * Lower noise levels, better luminosity dynamic
      range, better color gamut preferred.
    * Alternatively, faster shutter speed preferred.
    * Flash unit available.
    * There were issues with lighting being too dim in the photos
      taken by the smartphone.
    * Higher resolution, higher sharpness, narrow depth-of-field,
      vignetting are possible, but must be considered in conjunction
      with the chosen lens.

* Flash unit
    * Lighting conditions were undesirable, and flash illumination is
      the preferred approach to correct this.

* Long focal length prime lens
    * Sharp, high resolution preferred.
    * Alternatively, fast shutter speed, narrow depth-of-field, minor
      vignetting preferred.
    * Don't care about wide angle.

* Short focal length prime lens
    * Willing to compromise on some sharpness, but resolution will
      still be high.  Vignetting may occur on wider depth-of-field.
    * Wide angle preferred.
    * Don't care about narrow depth-of-field, fast shutter speed.

* Zoom lens
    * Willing to compromise on some more sharpness, possibly also
      color gamut.
    * Don't care about narrow depth-of-field, fast shutter speed,
      vignetting.

* Tripod
    * Super-resolution is desired.
    * Slower shutter speeds like 1/25 second are desired.

Finally, to reiterate, as we know in professional photography, a
client/customer can only see sharp, high resolution if they are either
viewing on a sharp, high resolution display or are eager to zoom and
pan the photo on a low-resolution smartphone display.
