Concerned about getting COVID-19 from the grocery store or an adjacent
outdoor runner that coughs on you when you are walking?  Don't be.
The main risk is spending a significant amount of time indoors sharing
the same air space as other people.  This means workplaces,
restaurants, face to face interaction, social gatherings, and public
transport.  Interestingly, incidental social interaction in hallways
and elevators does not have significant virus transmission risk.

Yes, it is how you spend your time that has the biggest influence on
your propensity to get the virus.

**do not** hold in indoor spaces.
