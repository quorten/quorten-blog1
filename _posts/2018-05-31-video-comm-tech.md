Video!  Why do we even have to think about communication in natural
language?  When our technology was more primitive, it was the only
convenient way to communicate.  Of course, now with video
telecommunication technology, video communications can provide a much
more convenient way of communicating, not subject to the symbolic
incompatibility of hapticly evolved human natural languages.

Wouldn't it be nice to be buddies and talk with someone from ancient
times?  There are some things that us moderners think considerable
difficulties, namely traveling long distances on foot to get around,
that surely someone from ancient times would laugh off our complaints
as silly.  Well, you don't have to cross the time boundary, you can
converse with people in less developed countries today, via
smartphones.  And machine translation?  No, you don't need that.  With
new advances in technology, there are by far less ambiguous, more
compatible ways to communicate in the modern era, namely video.
