Interesting article about steady decline of manufacturing jobs in the
United States.  Politicians promising to increase manufacturing jobs?
Nope, it's part of a general trend of decline independent of
particular politicians.  The trend is toward increasing automation,
which results in greater productivity: more product output with less
labor input.  This is a good thing in general.
