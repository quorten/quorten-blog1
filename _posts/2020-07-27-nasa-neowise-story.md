I put this in the `random-software` category because it is somewhat
related, I guess.  Interesting Hackaday article on a NASA satellite
where the hardware was well extended past its original mission,
NEOWISE.  The main thing I have to say software-related, looks like if
you have plenty of good foresight, you can keep using a hardware
system through software adaptation.
