You can hand-solder with leaded solder onto a cardboard circuit board,
but **do not** use a cardboard circuit board for reflow soldering.
The spontaneous combustion point of paper is 451 degrees Fahrenheit,
approximately the same temperature as your reflow solder point.
Likewise, due to the higher temperatures required for unleaded solder,
you should not use this with cardboard circuit boards either.  Or, for
the daring, if you are weary and careful at soldering, you can do it
okay even with the higher temperatures.

What are alternatives you can use in the way of your own plastic
sheets?  3D printed base is an option.  If you want sheets of plastic,
you can get them via 3D printing.
