Can you retrobright a yellowed with only hydrogren peroxide?  I'd
really like to do retrobrighting with less chemicals.

Well, the answer to that question is quite interesting.  It turns out
that you can retrobright with no chemicals at all, just bright
sunlight and exposure to the oxygen from open air.  This is a much
gentler process than the chemical-based ones.

That being said, it still leaves me with a lot of questions.  I have
some white plastic items that are covered by cardboard or stored in
boxes outside of the sunlight, but they are still in hot places.  Over
the years, they have curiously become yellow.  Is there possibly an
anti-retrobrightening process going on?  Retrobrighting can be done
with exposure to only infrared light, so its possible the infrared
light as radiated heat is doing something chemical that has an
undesirable effect in the absence of oxygen, which would come from
open air exposure.

Another note, the "active oxygen" part, i.e. Oxyclean, is only added
in a small quantity.  Purportedly if you used a thin layer of hydrogen
peroxide or some other method to ensure access to oxygen, this would
also work well?
