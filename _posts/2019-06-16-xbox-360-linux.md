So, as a continuation of my tiny libc project, I would really like to
be able to test running my code on a PowerPC architecture.  Lucky for
me, the Xbox 360 uses the PowerPC architecture, which is more easily
accessible hardware than some older PowerPC platforms like
late-generation Macintoshes.  But, the first order of business is to
be able to run Linux on the Xbox 360.  Surely, that should be easy, as
Xbox is a more open platform than the other gaming consoles.
Unfortunately, it isn't easy as the original Xbox, but it's still
doable, sometimes.  So long as you're not upgraded to the latest Xbox
kernel software, you should be good.
