What is the pin spacing distance on the Raspberry Pi Zero GPIO pin
header?  Well, let's see.  First of all, we know it must be the same
pin pitch as is used on the other conventional Raspberry Pi modules.

Second, let me try to measure it myself.  From first glace, it looks
like it must be 3 mm.

Okay, now let's try searching for official numbers.  Oh, close guess,
but not quite.  Actually, the pin pitch is 0.1 inch = 2.54 mm.
