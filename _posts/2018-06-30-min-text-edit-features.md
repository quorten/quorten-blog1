Now, what about minimal features for text editors?  Okay, now we have
to make two distinctions here.  Basic text editors for any user, and
text editors for programmers.

Basic text editors for any user:

* Text entry (obvious)
* Visual browsing of already entered text
* Visual editing of already entered text
* Mouse support
* Menu of available commands
* Delete region
* Cut, copy, and paste
* Multi-level undo and redo
* Search and replace
* Spell checking on demand
* Continuous spell checking

* Optional, typically used on phones:
  Abbreviations/auto-type/autocompletion
* Word processors and smartphones only: Auto-correction

* Lookup a word in a dictionary or other reference
* Follow a hyperlink

* Graphical widgets for rich text editing

Text editors for programmers:

* Includes all features listed above, **except** the following:
    * Auto-correction

* Command-line/command-based text editing
    * Command-line/command-based rich text editing
    * Hot-keys for rich text editing
* Regular expression search and replace
* Auto-indentation, reformatting of regions
* Keyboard macros
* Source debugger
* Extensibility/programmability for plugins and extensions

Again, I reiterate, because this is important!  Curiously, drawing
programs aren't very popular on smartphones, even though they are
fairly popular on tablets, laptops, and desktops.  Text entry and
voice are the almost exclusive forms of user input on a smartphone.
Photos are the exclusive form of more general graphical input on a
smartphone, and the touchscreen is exclusively used for navigating
graphical user interfaces (either via traditional push buttons or
modern gestures), not drawing.

* Footnote: Perhaps I should qualify this, traditionally they were one
  of the most popular programs on personal computers, but the advent
  of many modern information worker jobs has since decreased their
  popularity among average desktop and laptop users.  Among the subset
  of users who are recreational computer users, especially children,
  drawing programs still are popular.  However, in modern times, the
  advent of easy access to broadband Internet has decreased the
  popularity of drawing programs even among recreational computer
  users, even among children.  Suffice it to say, "the Internet" has a
  much different user interface, one that is espoused most
  distinctively in my assessment of the popularity of user interface
  modes in smartphones: The touch interface is used to navigate the
  'mechanics" of the smartphone, but the actual content communication
  of the Internet is exclusively text, audio, photos, and video.  No
  drawings.  So how are drawings ever communicated on the Internet?
  The drawing is done on paper, and a photo of the paper is taken,
  with a smartphone, of course.

* Indeed, this does make diagramming software a distinct quality of
  laptop and desktop computing.  The concept simply isn't exercised in
  the arena of smartphones.  What about tablets?  I have yet to hear
  of anyone doing extensive diagramming on a tablet.  I believe
  tablets are mainly used for art drawing, not technical drawing.
