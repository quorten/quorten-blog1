Important!  "The 5 hour rule" that makes entrepreneurs such as Bill
Gates, Jack Ma, and Elon Musk great.  Set aside 5 hours out of your
week to learn something, to read something, to reflect on something,
or to experiment on something.  But now, the counterpoint that we must
mention.  The fact that there are a large number of people who don't
set aside 5 hours to learn something, well, that's a large part of the
reason why we have so many people who _use_ smartphones, but so few
people who understand how they work.
