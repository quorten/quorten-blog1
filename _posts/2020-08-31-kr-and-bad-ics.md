Kai Robinson's Macintosh SE/30 reverse engineering project?  Oh wow,
I've found some contact points mentioned here I didn't see before,
after finding this discussion on 68kMLA.

First of all, Kai Robinson is on Twitter.

Second, Kai Robinson created a GitHub repository for his work on the
project so far.  I should really follow up on this, I would reckon it
is better to have all the information in one repository if possible.
Sure, yeah, that means multiple people would be contributing and there
would therefore be a greater need for coordination and organization.

Macintosh SE/30 ROM dumps?  The `synack.net` site contains a copy of
them.  Interesting, and important for Macintosh SE/30 recreations.

Now, this is interesting.  Following Kai Robinson's Twitter account,
I've seen this mention from Tube Time about identifying counterfeit
integrated circuits.  That is, in particular, integrated circuits that
were salvaged from older electronics but marked up as if they were
manufactured brand new.  The main telltale sign is that the labeling
is sub-par.
