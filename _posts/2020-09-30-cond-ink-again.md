Okay, fine.  I finally have to clear up a bad idea that I thought of
as an alternative to buying conductive ink.  How about hot gluing bits
of aluminum foil to your silicone in the chiclet keyboard?

Don't do it, aluminum foil is indeed too conductive, as I have
suspected.  Also, because the surface is too smooth and slick, hot
glue simply won't make a good bond with it.

If the conductive ink is water-soluble, yes, it is certainly
carbon-based.  Other conductive inks that are based off of silver,
copper, nickel, or other metals require the use of often toxic
solvents in order to get their inking properties, and they may require
curing rather than simple air drying.  So I am told.  And then, if
that is the case, simple water won't be able to wash them away like
what happened to my mistreated keyboard.  So, all that being said,
carbon-based conductive ink is your go-to for simple, easy, and cheap
keyboard repair.

So, the product pitch.  Electric Paint looks like a particular good
choice for my use because it was specifically designed to be nontoxic
and easy to use.

Oh, and the final word.  You really want to stick metals together?
Well, yes, soldering would be my go-to recommendation, in that case
buy copper foil rather than aluminum foil, you can't solder to
aluminum except by first electroplating with copper.  But, if you
really really want to join metal to some non-metal in a glue-like
fashion, then you need to buy metal glue.  Or, the other option noted
in the Yahoo Answer, you can join with clay and then glue the clay.  I
guess you could say it's really the same thing as a special metal
glue.

Also, please note: My [previous blog article on the subject]({{
site.baseurl }}/blog/2019/08/06/cond-ink-revisit).

So, the advantage over my previous find?  Electric Paint is available
in a smaller 10 mL tube.  The price per milliliter, however, is
exactly the same for the larger sizes, despite the brand differences.

PLEASE NOTE, however, while the Archaic Elements product can be used
for electroforming, the Bare Conductive product cannot.  It is solely
for creating conductive surfaces for electronic circuits.  At least it
is proven to be bood for creating electric shielding cases by virtue
of painting, however.

Okay, smaller quantity, go with this brand instead.  Oh, and also a
good note in the comments.  Deteriorated traces can also be a cause of
a non-functioning keyboard, so I should check the resistance of the
trace layers on that plastic sheet inside my keyboard to be repaired.
If that's not working, then that needs more work too.

Oh, and the issue?  "I would highly recommend wearing a mask and
[working in] a well ventilated room."

Oh, and, another great review.

Oh, and modge podge is a type of glue, basically.

So... I think I'm sold.  You want easy, safe, non-toxic, and small
quantity?  Limit electroforming/electroplating outside the scope of
your project, and buy Electric Paint.

The only other sane alternative is to make your own conductive ink
from pencil graphite, water, and glue.
