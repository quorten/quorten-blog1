Quorten Blog 1 started out as mere text files written in a 
quasi-Markdown syntax, originally not available online.  Actually, most 
of the text came from only two huge text files.  With the help of some 
automated conversion tools, these notes were brought into the 21st 
century in blog form.  Incidentally, many of my notes were summaries of 
information that came from existing blogs, but sure, you know the way 
the web works... more redundant information in slightly different forms 
always improves the quality of search engine results.

The imported posts encompass most of my previously written tech notes in 
terms of volume.  Although there will be more older notes to come, most 
of them will be fairly small compared to the initial import.
