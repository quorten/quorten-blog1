I don't think "anarchy" will emerge, but the future will be quite
ordered, following the line of Perl that we've previously seen.

<!-- more -->

My feeling is that new feature adoption in the core language will get
stiffer in the following months/years, the existing Python core
language developers will focus on maintenance mode, and those seeking
new language features will migrate to other languages.  (How will new
Python core developers be inducted?  Easy, they won't be inducted.)
Like Perl, the package ecosystem though will likely not change very
much.  There will still be new packages created and maintained, but
the growth curve will remain fixed, and the new, steep exponential
growth in package production will happen in other languages.

Wow, very interesting article here.

But Python is still the most popular and fastest growing language.
