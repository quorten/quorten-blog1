This is a really interesting article about the Roseau stone that was
thought to be lost, but has been found.  What happened?  It was left
sitting around on a historian's desk while the question of what to
officially do with it was unanswered, and was there for many years
until the historian's death.  What happened then?  All of the contents
of his office were diligently archived without loss.  Yes, indeed in
the midst of the University of Minnesota's history department,
worker's desk contents are archived in totality without fail, unlike
the rest of the business world that would have swiftly thrown
everything away.  So, as soon as modern historians were able to trace
this chain of custody history up to this point, they were able to
consult the archival location of the historian's desk contents and the
Roseau stone was found once again.
