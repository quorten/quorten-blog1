Endocrine disruptors, wow do they sound dangerous.  So, what does
Wikipedia have to say about them?  Quite a lot of interesting things.

* Some brominated flame retardants are endocrine disruptors.  Flame
  retardants of some sort are used in almost every plastic, because
  most plastics will spontaneously combust when heated above a certain
  temperature.  Although the pure plastic itself may have no endocrine
  disruptors on its own, the flame retardant additive can make it so.
  (Note that I discuss flame retardants in more detail in a
  [subsequent blog post]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/blog/2019/01/21/paper-mache-rpi-plastic))

* Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is essentially the precursor to
  common brominated flame retardant PDBE.  PCB is, likewise, also an
  endocrine disruptor.

* Plasticizer additives, used to make an otherwise rigid plastic
  softer and more flexible, are another common source of endocrine
  disruptors.  Typically, phthalates are used.  Again, a pure plastic
  on its own may contain no endocrine disruptors, but the plasticizer
  additive makes it so.

* Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor.  "BPA-free" products
  may substitute Bisphenol S instead, which can be even more
  dangerous.  These chemicals are used to line either plastic beverage
  containers **or** aluminum beverage containers for additional wet
  strength.

* Polycarbonate can hydrolize into Bisphenol A (BPA) under high
  temperatures and high humidity, and therefore although polycarbonate
  in its pure form may not be an endocrine disruptor, it can readily
  transform into one, especially under the conditions present in
  manufacturing, 3D printing, and incineration.

* Phthalates used in thermal paper receipts are often endocrine
  disruptors.

* Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) may contain also contains endocrine
  disruptors, due to phthalate platicizer additives.

* Burning polyvinyl chloride from trash incineration is one of the
  world'ls largest sources of dioxin.  Also, dioxins are created in
  the manufacturing process.  Yep, the end of DDT and Agent Orange did
  not stop the dioxins from coming to us.

* Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is suspected of being capable of
  leaching out endocrine disruptors.  Due to the inclusion of a type
  of phthalate (terephthalate), suffice it to say that PET plastic
  contains endocrine disruptors.

* One major source, of course, of human intake and exposure to
  endocrine disruptors is through food containers.  Due to the demands
  of food containers, especially those that need to carry wet
  materials, it is very likely that some chemical endocrine disruptor
  additives were placed into the packaging, and these chemicals can
  then transfer to the food contained.  Heating food containers, like
  what may be done in a microwave, is also a source of endocrine
  disruptors leaching into food.

* Another major source of human intake and exposure to endocrine
  disruptors is through dust in artificial interiors: household,
  automotive, office, you name it.  If there is dust that can flake
  off a built surface that contains endocrine disruptors, and humans
  can inhale it, the endocrine disruptors can enter their body.
  Typically, this is due to plastic surfaces or plastic-like wood
  finishes.

    * Notably, toddlers who live in the same households as adults may
      have higher levels of endocrine disruptors in their body due to
      ingesting dust that adults, by contrast, do not ingest.  Adults
      know better than to eat dust.

* Interesting:

Theo Colborn was a notable researcher and publisher involved in
describing the effects of endocrine disruptors.

This is an interesting documentary movie that investigates the
question: are stinky chemicals bad for your health?  The answer is
yes, and it goes through the interesting stories of how these
chemicals were justified into mass production.

Now, speaking of all the problems with endocrine disruptors, how do
the "classic toxic metals" such as mercury, lead, arsenic, and
antimony compare?  Do they cause heritable deformations?  Apparently,
the only such metal that can cause heritable deformations is arsenic.
It turns out that antimony is not particularly hazardous to human
health in general.  This is good news, as that means the antimony that
was traditionally used in the production of polyethyline is not too
much of a concern.

Notably, mercury and lead were some of the few metals that were known
since antiquity.  That being said, given they were discovered and
used, if only by a few, so many thousands of years ago, and we humans
have still survived to this day, we know they have a proven track
record of only being a limited risk to humans as a species.  Mercury,
lead, and arsenic are bioaccumulators, so the main risk these pose is
biomagnification in the food chain, not heritable deformations.

The introduction to the Wikipedia article on the metals of antiquity
is quite awe-inspiring.

> The metals of antiquity are the seven metals which humans had
> identified and found use for in prehistoric times: gold, silver,
> copper, tin, lead, iron, and mercury. These seven are the metals
> from which the modern world was forged; until the discovery of
