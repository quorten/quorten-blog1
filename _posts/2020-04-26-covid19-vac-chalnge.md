What is the current status on the COVID-19 vaccine?  Well, well,
Wikipedia is the first find for reporting the current status.

So, what does this all mean?  Looks like there could be a high
probability of at least one COVID-19 succeeding all the clinical
research trials.  However... we have reason to cast doubt on the
success numbers due to the hurried nature of the vaccine development.
It could be that all the candidates fail at a much higher rate.

Besides, we've never got a single vaccine certified for any previous
human Coronavirus.  It could be that we just have to live out this
virus without the luxury of vaccines, not to mention it's not even
clear whether contracting the real COVID-19 directly builds long-term
immunity, there is already evidence of reinfections.
