Wow, now this is great.  First it was GitHub... okay, I guess not
really.  My point is that GitHub was the first big player that I saw
demonstrating the technique for others to follow.  Specifically,
putting the _source text_ of legal terms/codes up on GitHub, from
which software uses to automatically generate web-friendly publication
versions, print versions, etc.  Now, Washington DC of the United
States is officially doing likewise with the DC legal code.  In case
you were suspecting/wondering, indeed, the older processes that
lawmakers used 10-20 years before was to create draft documents in
Microsoft Word, then manually merge them together.  This is important
to note, however.  It's not like using software automation to merge
drafts and generate the final document couldn't be done at the time.
It's that the talent pool of people in the earlier law field weren't
very experienced with computers at the time, so using the most
user-friendly solution was the key, even if it mean that other things
would be less efficient.
