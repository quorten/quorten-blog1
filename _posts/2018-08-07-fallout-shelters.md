Fallout shelter?  Ah, the signs are being taken down now that they are
misleading.  New York City in 2017, for example.

Blast doors you ask?  Oh, another thing that came from the nuclear
era.

So there have been a lot of media coverage about possible things that
can go wrong with fallout shelters.  This is not what I was thinking
about, this is something else.  Not the one where people go hide in
the shelter and come out only many years later.
