* Actually trying out my visual inventory system.  It's amazing how
  much great amounts of detail can be contained within a single
  photograph.  I have to self-profess the system as amazing.  My test:
  If I can get all these objects back in the bag exactly how they came
  out, then the system is amazing.  And guess what?  The system
  delivered on that goal.

* Biased image coverage.  Google Street View, Google Earth.  Take, for
  example, Google Earth.  Google Earth provides ample high resolution
  imagery over land and cityscapes, but the resolution coverage over
  the ocean is considerably lower.  Yet, oceans over over 75% of the
  Earth's surface.  So there are some huge biases at work in Google
  Earth, but at least you can calculate them and determine that they
  are there in the sample data.

  Going forward into the future, should you so desire, you could
  rescan those areas at the same resolution as the land areas.  But
  for past data, we don't have any such solution.  With current
  technologies (as of 2017), you can't travel back in time to rescan
  those areas at their full resolution.  Surely it would be awesome if
  we could travel to ancient times and scan the Earth!  Unfortunately,
  we can't do that.  All we can do is point out that we don't have
  data at that time era because _at the time_, technology wasn't
  advanced enough to collect that kind of data.  Then we can factor
  that into our decision-making that our decisions are being biased by
  only considering present data that we have at high resolution, even
  though the past world existed.  It's just that we are not
  considering the past world.
