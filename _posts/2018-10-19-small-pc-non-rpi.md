Important!  Thinking about using a Raspberry Pi as a replacement for a
typical desktop PC?  Well, then think again.  For that particular
purpose, there are a lot more market options to consider that may be
better.  The primary use of a Raspberry Pi is if you want to do a lot
with hardware.  Robots, weather stations, things like that.  If you're
just interested in checking your E-mail and surfing the Internet,
there are better options for you that are cheaper.  Yes, through away
the ability to connect with exotic hardware and you've got a much
cheaper and more computationally powerful system to boot.
