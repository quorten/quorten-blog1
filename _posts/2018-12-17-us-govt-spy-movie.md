So, again, from the SYFY movie channel on a random TV screen that I
saw, I searched the sechdule to find out what was currently playing
and the name of that movie.  This time, it is the movie _Enemy of the
State_, showcasing NSA surveillance technology determined as plausible
in the 1990s.

Interestingly, the movie crew hired a "technical surveillance
counter-measures consultant" to determine how to setup the depiction
of NSA technologies used.  That is, someone who professional
investigates for spy devices and how to rid them.

Nevertheless, there were a few fictional things in the movie like the
3D reconstruction when Daniel Zavitz bumped into Robert Clayton Dean
and slipped the video disc into his groceries bag.  Surely, the
on-premises security cameras wouldn't have been the high definition
color video cameras nor in sufficient quantity to perform a high
definition photogrammetric reconstruction, unless the place was
already placed under NSA surveillance using NSA placed bugs.  Were
they on-premises cameras, the NSA still would have had a hard time
getting the data reasonably quickly, a mailout of the data being the
only fast way to deliver the data at the time.

Indeed, the Wikipedia "Talk" article does discuss this implausibility.
