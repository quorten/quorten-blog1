How is EOMA68 doing?  Any updates?  Nope, none since my last notes.
However, Libre RISC-V M-Class is making some interesting progress.
More EU NLNet grants coming, and building interest over the Libre
RISC-V M-Class filling a niche market of more programmable GPGPUs that
has not been able to open up due to the inertia of the incumbent
players.
