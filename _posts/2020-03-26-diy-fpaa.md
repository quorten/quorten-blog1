Field programmable analog arrays, mixed signal field programmable gate
arrays.  Yes, yes, these would be the ultimate ideals in having
reprogrammable hardware, but they are hard to come by.

Alas, there is an easier and more commercially abundant solution.
With some lateral thinking, of course it makes sense.  I've seen the
"bilateral switch" solid-state analog switching chips that team
together two separate analog switches into one chip.  Why not make
such a chip that teams together a grid of such switches on a matrix of
wires?  Indeed, I've found such a chip right here.  You can get either
an 8x8 or 16x8 grid, and every single switch is individually
accessible via an address bus.

Okay, that's all good and nice from a necessary features standpoint,
but how do you use this as a programmable array of discrete analog
components?  Here's how it's done.  In the most flexible
implementation, you use a square N x N grid.  All discrete analog
components, input wires, and output wires are placed on one side of
the N grid, and the other side of the N grid is strictly used for
wiring together components.

Of course, you may realize that once you wire together a bunch of
components and then want to stick an input or output wire to one of
them, you're just sharing the same wiring island, so why not just use
one of the pins on the reserved N interconnect wire side when you need
inputs and outputs?  Indeed, you can make this step and revise the
specifications as follows.  One side of N pins exclusively wires to
the programmable analog components, and the other side of N pins
exclusively serves for I/O pins.

Here is a great article on Digi-Key about the fate of Field
Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs).  What happened to them?  Why did
they seem to go nowhere?  As it turns out, due to the often
specialized, small, and very limited use of analog components in a
larger circuit, the benefits never really outweighed the costs, so
they simply didn't catch on.

Nevertheless, I must concede.  There is a clear use of limited-side
field programmable analog arrays within many types of hobby class
circuits that I can think of.  Often times I find myself with a small
handful of simple circuit designs that involve analog components and
simple wiring changes.  I pretty much never need to use the multiple
designs simultaneously... so therefore I could just create one board
with the components on it and programmatically rewire them as I need.

Or, even better... in some cases I could probably literally
"multitask" my field programmable analog array.
