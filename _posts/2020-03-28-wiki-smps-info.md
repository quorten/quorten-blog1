Switched-mode power supplies, switched-mode power supplies.  Gosh they
can be difficult to understand.  So again I go looking back at
Wikipedia, and of course I should have known.  The Wikipedia article
on switched-mode power supplies is a good table of contents for all
variations of the switched-mode power supply design.

In particular, I'm using a SEPIC switched-mode power supply design,
and this article has really helped me better understand how it works.
