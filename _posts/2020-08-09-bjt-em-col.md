Almost every BJT transistor architecture construction diagrams shows a
symmetric device.  So, is there really any difference in operating a
BJT transistor if you swap around emitter and collector?  Indeed,
there is, and it is due to the fact that these are always _simplified_
diagrams.  Generally, one of the two sides is more heavily doped
and/or larger than the other.  So this is what makes the transistor
perform much better when operated one way than the other.  However, it
is still possible to operate the transistor with emitter and collector
reversed, it's just that you can only do so with a much smaller
current.  The particular niche application where you got better
specifications on one parameter was all but replaced by modern MOSFETs
instead.
