Ah, yes!  Red List building materials.  This ia a great summation that
agrees with much of my previous materials science discussion.
However...  the summary of the red list falls short by not mentioning
alternative materials to use.  Maybe that is included in more detail
on the direct site.  Also, it does not address the question I've posed
earlier: if you abuse this material, will it transform into one of the
mentioned hazardous materials?
