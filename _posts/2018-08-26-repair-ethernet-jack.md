How do you repair a broken tab on an Ethernet jack?  Here's how.

First way, my recommendation.  Buy some RJCLIPs to use in place of
your broken tabs.

Second way, older trick: Use appropriately sized zip ties to make your
own jack.  Make sure you select zip ties of the appropriate width,
else it won't work.  4.3mm head width is what you are targeting.

Third way: Glue the broken head into a coupler or extension to get a
good head back.

Make your own tab protector for an Ethernet cable with a non-broken,
non-protected tab.
