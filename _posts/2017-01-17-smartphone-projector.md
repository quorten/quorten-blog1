Whoa... so I've been fooled.  You can turn a mobile phone into a video
projector with ease.  You only need a single magnifying glass lens.

* So that's another use of the 4K smartphone screens, in addition to
  Google Cardboard VR.

Note that the article has links to more sophisticated projects too.

Gosh, now I have to reconsider... if you can do this many things with
a smartphone, why do you even need the bigger computing devices?

Okay, never mind, no need to search for "orthographic projectors"...
yeah, they do exist, just run an orthographic camera in reverse.  But
they are not quite as common.

* You don't need to wait for 4K projectors to come on the market if
  you use a 4K smartphone as your 4K projector.  You might even have
  luck making an 8K projection screen if you put together four 4K
  smartphones.

Yeah, so same photographic concepts here.  On one hand, you could just
try to use a pinhole aperture, but then you don't get good light
intensity.  If you want depth-of-field, then yes you can use a lens,
but otherwise that is the disadvantage.  The advantage of course is
that there is in fact greater light intensity focused.  Bigger lenses
better for this, of course.

* Good point!  So, to explain the concepts easily.  It's like you just
  imagine a camera in reverse, and then you've got a projector.  All
  the concepts of aperture, focus, and depth-of-field are the same.
  But exposure time is not, only immediate intensity measures matter
  in the case of projectors.

** Or wait, well, good idea.  Long exposures to compensate for
   low-power projectors.  Then again, bad idea if the exposures end up
   taking just too long.

* So now you're asking.  Is this really a good design?  You have to
  build a projector housing for a smartphone.  Well, if I had to make
  a call, I think it would actually work quite well for those who are
  into arts and crafts, well, you know, artists, so 3D scanning this
  way should work well!

* Well, and yeah, if you use two smartphones, then the projector can
  optically triangulate itself, or you can use that other technique.
  Oh yeah, and you've got networking too for app development.

Ha, funny way of putting it.

* Projector not working?  Well you can turn your smartphone (or laptop
  or anything else) into a projector of your own.

Important!  So, what are the merits of the smartphone projector system
for 3D scanning?  Well, let's put it this way.  The weakness is
brightness and power consumption.  Laser lines are brighter and
consume less power, hence their optical systems are easier and cheaper
to setup.  On the other hand, incoherent light can work better with
rough objects, and the lack of brightness can be better for 3D
scanning faces.

So, in this, we also have to admit that projectors pose similar
dangers to that of lasers.  However, due to not being coherent light,
the intense light does not travel nearly as far, so it is not as
dangerous to use in outdoor environments, though for indoor
environments and short distances, the tradeoffs are basically the
same.
