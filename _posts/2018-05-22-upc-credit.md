So, you're wondering about the historic timeline of credit cards and
UPC barcodes?  Here it is.

* Earlier: Checking account bank numbers, checks, wire transfers.
* 1973: Magnetic strip credit card
* 1973/1974: UPC barcode

In the earlier days, there were no standardized credit cards.
However, there were some merchants with their own card systems that
could only be used with those merchants.
