This is a great article about the mistakes made, lessons learned, and
the proper technique for removing surface-mount capacitors from
vintage Macintosh logic boards.  The old technique of using a
soldering iron should **not** be used, as this tends to put stress on
the pads and is in fact the worst technique.  Rather, cold removal
should be done, by pushing with downforce on the capacitor and gently
twisting it left and right by not too much a distance, and the
capacitor will break right out, leaving the leads still on the pads.

Note that clipping off the surface-mount capacitors is also risky and
can also result in lifted pads.
