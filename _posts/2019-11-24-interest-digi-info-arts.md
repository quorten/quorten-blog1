Wow, so when getting ready to get started on Digi-Key for making my
first purchase from there, I found an interesting blog article and the
`maker.io` site that is sponsored by Digi-Key.  Digi-Key is definitely
a growing company.  Surprise surprise, Digi-Key even sells a 14 pound
brass sledgehammer!
