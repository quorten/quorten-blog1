`hginit.com`?  Alas, going to the website, it's broken!

I remember back in the day when reading the Joel on Software blog, I
saw the website advertised as a good introduction to Mercurial.  Why
was Joel Spolsky and friends using Mercurial?  Back in the day,
Windows computers used to be quite common in corporate offices, and
between Mercurial and Git both being good distributed version control
systems, Mercurial was slightly more Windows friendly, so a lot of
people went with that one pretty much for that sole reason.  And
Mercurial was quite alive and well for many years, until the entire
world changed.  After several blunders in a row on the side of
Microsoft, the rise of Android smartphones, the influence of
university computer science education teaching Unix, the general
fading away of the old world "cottage industry" of software
development... and consequentially, all of these combined, the popular
preference of software developers for Mac computers, and the fact that
by now, most corporate IT departments officially supported Mac
computers just as well as they supported Windows computers...

**ALL** of this together meant that the old world environmental
assumptions behind Joel Spolsky on Mercurial and Windows together were
rendered obsolete.  Thus, I can understand why Joel Spolsky has
stopped renewing the domain name.

Does Joel Spolsky have an official statement on retiring `hginit.com`?
As far as I can see, no.  All I can see is news dating from 2010
announcing `hginit.com`.

Okay, okay, what's going on at the modern Joel on Software website?  I
can see that it has been redesigned quite a bit to make it
look... more modern, of course!
