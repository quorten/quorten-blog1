Very interesting GitHub article on why empathy matters here.

Debunking myths!  Different conditions here, autism and alexithymia.
The point here is that alexithymia tends to be correlated with any
mental disorder, "eating disorders, depression, substance abuse,
schizophrenia and many other psychiatric and neurological conditions."
However, the diagnosis must be understood to be separate from all
those other conditions.  Autism and alexithymia are only correlated
50% of the time, so making the assumption means that you are wrong 50%
of the time.

Wow, this is really interesting: Childhood disintegrative disorder, or
CDD.  The mental deviation that has no traceable signs from either
genetics or brain scans that differentiate it from a normal human
brain.  Rather, all signs point to that of a human brain of an
equivalent neurotypical 2-year old or similar.  And yet this is now
classified as a sub-form of the autism spectrum; even though the
surface-level observation makes it look similar to autism, deeper
inspection shows that it is apparently nothing like typical autism.

Indeed, the human brain is this great puzzle that nobody really fully
understands yet.
