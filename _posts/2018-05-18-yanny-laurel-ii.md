So, here is more information about this Yanny or Laurel thing.  The
sound recording was not well done, so it has some high frequency
echoes of the low frequency sounds.  Depending on the speaker system
used to listen to this, the gains on the frequencies will be different
such that you can hear either Yanny or Laurel.  Also, you can separate
out the sounds.  The low frequency is around 200 Hz, the high
frequency is around 3000 Hz to 6000 Hz, which creates an interesting
effect as both are at the far sides of human hearing where the
perceived intensity will be lower than the middle frequencies.  Also,
humans are trained to listen for human voices and filter out other
sounds, so this also factors into play as to what different people
will hear when listening to this.  Younger listeners tend to hear
Yanny more often than older listeners, for several reasons mentioned
above, and the fact that older listeners will have a more attenuated
response on higher frequencies compared to younger listeners.
