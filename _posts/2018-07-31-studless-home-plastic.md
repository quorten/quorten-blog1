Interesting technological research and development here.

A studless home building method?  Okay, so the idea made clear here is
that the emphasis is on the external walls.  So, that can help avoid
the issue of not having studs to mount heavy items on the internal
walls.

Adding lignin to plastic?  That degrades paper!  Sure, but the point
here is to have a biodegradable plastic with some favorable
properties.
