So, about potato cleaning.  Cook or no cook before clean?  It must be
no cooking before using it to clean.  Sprinkle generously with baking
soda, then rub away.  Actually, sweet potatoes are more effective
because they have a higher concentration of oxalic acid.  Also,
carrots have an even higher concentration, but they may be more
difficult to work with.

Now, some of my contacts could just as well be iron, but others
are almost surely nickel.  Is there a separate cleaning method
for that?

Also, some are for sure brass/copper.  Purportedly you would use
similar cleaning methods for that.

Ah, the famed method is to use electrolysis to remove corrosion.
