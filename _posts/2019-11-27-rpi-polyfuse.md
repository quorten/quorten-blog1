What polyfuse should be used with Raspberry Pi Zero in a larger board
circuit?  Look to the Raspberry Pi B+ or original Raspberry Pi
schematics for guidance.  Then, you simply search around for a part
with similar specifications to use in your own circuit.  One design
note in particular, you should place the polyfuse immediately after
your power input source.  Your first isolating capacitor should come
after the polyfuse.
