Solid-state memory?  What does Wikipedia have to say about this?  Oh,
interesting.  So the most interesting point in hand is the positioning
on archival use of solid-state memory.  First of all, we do know from
first-hand experience from BIOS firmware that solid-state memory does
last quite a long time, even without refreshes.  However, according to
Wikipedia, for larger capacities of solid-state memory, errors can
occur after only 1-2 years in storage.  Solid-state memory retention
is more reliable when powered on and wear-leveling is continously
operating.  Also, solid-state drives tend to have the same failure
rates based off of _age_, more so than the intensity of use.  The
article on longevity is from the year 2015.
