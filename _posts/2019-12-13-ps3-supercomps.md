PS3 supercomputers, a fragment of time.  Also it's interesting as some
have commented elsewhere, the advanced Cell processor architecture
never really became popular among game programmers, mainly because
very few were making their own game engines.  Instead, they were
repurposing on top of Unity3D, and that's also why the specific
platform features are no longer as important as they use to be.
