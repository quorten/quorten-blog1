How do you uninstall software via Powershell on Windows?  Here's the
lowdown.  Unfortunately, there is a scatter-brain chaos here when it
comes to Windows software install management.  There are two ways to
do this.  The more "modern" way involves the `Win32_package` class in
`wmic`.

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_product
wmic product where "name='<SOFTWARE-NAME>'" uninstall
```

Alas, older software installers use a different outdated technique
where you must go through registry keys.  Even worse, there is not
always guaranteed to be a silent uninstaller available, so GUI dialogs
might pop up that will have to be automated away by generating
artificial input.  As we've picked up a hint from our previous sources
on that technique, let's search around more on the tech details.  And here
we are, we have an answer article on .

And here we go.

```
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, InstallDate | Format-Table â€“AutoSize

$RegPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall", "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"

$app = Get-ChildItem -Path $RegPath | Get-ItemProperty | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -match "firefox" }
```
